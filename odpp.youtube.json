      "title": "The Phone Thats Fighting Big Tech - Fairphone 4 Teardown and Repair Assessment",
      "transcript": "this is fairphone4 the phone that sets out to be different from the rest with up to 5 years warranty long-term software support and ease of repair this sounds like a phone you truly own as well as being good for you it's also more sustainably made included is just the phone and some paperwork to no surprise there isn't an included charger but fairphone has taken it a step further with no usb cable either i hope your old one isn't worn out either because fairphone charges 60 euros or around 90 australian dollars for an official charger and cable the first of this phone's problems is actually purchasing one you can buy directly from fairphone if you live in the eu or uk but if you live elsewhere they won't sell you their product i can't imagine the logistics and legislation that you would have to abide by just to sell a product so i can somewhat understand this but for a phone maker that's been around for almost a decade it seems strange as of this it took me two years just to get one for this video emails to fairphone directly or through someone who had been talking to their pr team got me nowhere usually buying the phone is the easy part of these videos when one appeared on ebay from the uk for 909 australian dollars i just had to have it this particular model is the grey colorway with 128 gigs of storage and 6 gigs of ram but a 256 gig model with 8 gigs of ram is also available from the outside it looks pretty standard to a regular phone but it's how it's built that's different to anything else on the market and it all starts at the back where you won't find fragile glass glued into place but a plastic back that unclips inside things look similar to most android phones but with a repairable twist the addition of some groovy graphics provide info on what each part is and you won't find a glued in battery here it's essentially a modern phone with the opening procedure of an old nokia this idea isn't genius it's something that used to be expected and something that should be made mandatory along with being easy to open you can also buy replacement parts direct from fairphone with such a large emphasis on repair i wanted to follow an official guide to take it apart the problem i couldn't find it find and fix an issue yourself sounded like the right place to be and while it pointed you towards purchasing the part it didn't show me where to find any installation guide it also wasn't anywhere to be found on the spare parts page after about 30 minutes i found it on the quick start manual under watch video tutorials which pointed to a youtube playlist with several repair videos later i also found it under a how-to section of the support page the effort is there but their website is really confusing an easy fix but still something worth mentioning i'll begin by removing the upper section which according to the graphic houses the camera and earpiece speaker there is a little access door that once removed reveals three flex cables for the cameras that need to be unplugged lifting it out of place you can see the antenna and camera come out as one piece this is how bare phones sell the replacement camera part while you can separate the cameras i understand this phone is designed to be simple to repair by everyone so doing it this way prevents an end user from getting dust or fingerprints over the cameras both cameras are 48 megapixels with the smallest one being the ultra wide camera if you only needed to replace the one camera that option is still possible as the cameras are not fused into the plastic antenna i found a hidden image of what appears to be a country this company is from the netherlands so that was my first thought but it's not shaped like that anyone else got any ideas of what it might be regardless i can remove the front camera and earpiece both of which are not secured with glue down at the lower section i can remove the speaker after its six phillips screws are unfastened attached to the speaker is a vibration motor with that out of the way we have access to the usbc port one cable is all it takes to get it out but something is missing do you see it where's the headphone jack well it seems i wasn't the only one asking fairphone made a video about it for us it has been a design decision so in order to make this phone last for five and even more years it is important that we remove any part of the phone that may break and since the audio jack fulfills a function that can also be done via your charging port we said hey let's bring those two functions together and then let's just put it into one usb port or connector so there you have it one of fair phones reasons for its removal is a phone designed to be repairable cannot have a headphone jack because it might break what do you think in my video about why companies really remove the headphone jack i discussed it was to push the sale of expensive unrepairable wireless headphones but there's no way the same company that made this phone would release wireless headphones with non-replaceable batteries right wrong let me introduce you to the fairphone wireless earbuds they might be built from some recycled materials but in the specs you'll find the batteries are not replaceable by design however they do offer hull replacement buds and charging cases but as both headphone batteries would degrade at a similar rate you'd likely be replacing both which would cost only 10 euros less than buying a new set that would also come with a charging case in my eyes fairphone is essentially the alternative phone that's more environmentally friendly repairable and open removing the headphone jack just takes away from that the mid section of plastic is secured using torx screws this area isn't obviously intended to be removed by the end user so let's see what's beneath well i've just uncovered another hidden feature dual sim capability the second physical sim slot is missing but its solder pads are present this phone is only available with one sim and one e-sim i wonder if i was to solder a sim reader on it if it would override the e-sim with nothing visibly securing the motherboard i tried to lift it out but it didn't budge after all we never did unplug the display which means its connector must be on the other side of the motherboard to remove the display there are eight screws around the perimeter of the phone once removed the screen can be lifted up using a suction cup and plastic pick absolutely no glue is holding the screen in place in fact with only eight screws holding it down the screen can be removed without even taking anything else out of the phone with it free the one connector can be detached looking at the display it's glued to a plastic frame and this frame is what then screws onto the phone a simple but really well executed design after the motherboard is out we're left with just a bare frame with the buttons intact these are not intended for user replacement as evidenced by the tape covering them and the lack of a replacement for sale on fair phone sign but with that we've completely disassembled the fairphone 4. if you've seen any of my other terana repair assessment videos you'll be amazed at just how simple this thing is to take apart but with some phones taking it apart is the least of your problems as the software is being programmed to reject any replacement part that's not installed by the manufacturer but that's not the case with this fair phone and repairability hasn't taken away from the specifications either this motherboard packs a snapdragon 750 g with 6 or 8 gigs of ram while almost having perfect modularity my only complaint is the 3 microphones and the proximity sensor are soldered directly onto the board it's time to get it all reassembled a process so easy just about anybody could do it there's no glue to reapply or crazy amount of screws to install typical repairs like the display cameras or charging port only take a matter of a few minutes you could replace every part of this phone in the time it would take to heat up the adhesive to even be able to open an iphone or samsung with the internals installed you might have noticed i didn't put the screen on first well with this phone you don't have to it can be installed with the heart of the phone still intact once its flex cable is attached i can simply press it down into place and attach the eight phillips screws i can now install the 3900 milliamp hour battery and back cover with that we're done so this is it the almost perfect repairable smartphone with easy to replace components a marketplace to buy genuine parts and an unlocked bootloader this is a phone you really own if you want to fix it customize it or flash different software you can and before you ask no this won't be becoming my new daily driver why well with no dual physical sim and no headphone jack it fails my basic phone needs after all my old phone still works perfectly and does everything i need it to so needlessly replacing it would be wasteful being an eu phone you might also be wondering can you even use it abroad while using my australian sim works perfectly good afternoon in the specs of this phone you'll find the compatible network bands so as long as your country has one of these it should work without issue and i should mention a user replaceable battery isn't just about ease of repair ability if you're on a holiday business trip or even out camping you can just swap out a battery in a few seconds and have a fully charged phone it doesn't seem as though fairphone sells an external charger but if they did you could better utilize that functionality and on that note this has been a huge jeffries video if you like

      "title": "Fairphone 4 Teardown: If Only Apple Made Phones Like This…",
      "transcript": "For years now, Fairphone has been making very\nrepairable phones. They always receive top marks on our repairability\nscale, and they are in many ways a beacon to the rest of the industry, an example of\nhow to design a repairable phone. And with right to repair legislation just\naround the corner, there’s no doubt other manufacturers will be begging to copy Fairphone’s\nhomework over the next few years. There are a few places Fairphone has struggled\nthough, which is why you may never have even heard of them. For starters, none of their phones are available\nin the US. You can buy one from overseas, but depending\non your carrier you may end up missing important cellular hardware. Beyond that, their focus on repairability\nhas historically meant compromising in the spec department. Old or underpowered chips in previous Fairphone\ndevices forced you to choose between a repairable, but sluggish device, and a less-repair-friendly\ndevice with a higher-end chip that will stay snappy for years. That compromise may no longer be an issue\nthough! Today we’re looking at the Fairphone 4,\nwhich has some major upgrades in the processor and camera departments, as well as 5G and\na hint of ingress protection, all while supposedly retaining its repairability. Today I’m going to explore that repairability,\ncalling out the good parts along with the not-so-good parts. I’m relieved to see a notch here for prying\nup the back cover. It is pretty difficult to remove though! I’m sure that’s part of the IP certification. Underneath, we’ve got maybe my favorite\npart of this design—labels. Easy to see and understand. I’m sure this slightly complicates manufacturing,\nbut it makes the product so much more approachable, especially to first time fixers. First I’ll go for the battery, which pops\nout with another quick fingernail pry. This is a 15.03Wh cell, about the same dimensions\nas an iPhone battery, minus the L-shape. Fairphone can safely accomplish this easy-remove\nbattery design because of the shell on this cell. Unlike iPhone batteries, this lithium ion\ncell is housed in a plastic shell, which protects it when it naturally expands, as well as when\nyou pick it out of the phone. Thanks to the shell, they can design the battery\nto bump up against all the parts around it, which hold it in place instead of adhesive. Then, the next best part, they use these exposed\nmetal contact points to transfer power, so no worrying about a fragile cable. Removing the battery is disconnecting it. Right under the battery is something that\nwill blow your mind. A microSD card reader. With this little card, which you can buy almost\nanywhere, I can add additonal storage space to this phone. Seriously, it is so sad that these aren’t\nstandard in phones anymore. So many phones could have a longer life if\nthere were only an easy way to add storage to them. (Looking at you, 16GB iPhone users) Next, I’m going to pull all the phillips\nscrews here, loosening both the camera and the loudspeaker covers. Under the camera cover are … cameras! There’s no need to remove these 48MP cameras\nfrom the frame though—Fairphone’s spare part for this includes the antenna bracket. Combining parts like this something to be\nwary of, but there are two things that make this work for Fairphone: number 1, the cameras\nare pretty easy to separate from this antenna if you have to, and number 2, attaching a\nlarge, low-cost component to something delicate and precise like a camera is actually not\na bad idea. It gives you something to hold on to, makes\nthe thing easier to keep track of, and makes sure that the cameras are precisely aligned,\nno matter who installs them. The lower antenna bracket has the vibration\nmotor and speaker attached to it, and underneath you have access to the modular usb-c port. Noticeably missing here is a 3.5mm headphone\njack. We have ... feelings about this, and you might\ntoo. It’s ultimately a matter of convenience,\nespecially since this usb-c port is so easy to remove. There’s just something about having a dedicated\nauxiliary port that we’ll never not miss. Under the heart label fastened with Torx screws\nis the middle section of this motherboard! Before I pull it out, I’ll disconnect the\nearpiece speaker and front-facing camera at the top of the phone. I don’t think this change of screws is to\nkeep people from accessing the motherboard, the way Apple devices sometimes use pentalobe\nscrews. Torx drivers are common, and the board is\nstill easy to remove and replace. Finally, the most important repair, which\nwe could have done right from the get-go, is the display! It’s held on with eight philips screws which\nthread all the way through to the back of the phone here. Compare that to an iPhone display repair,\nwhich, despite being among the easiest of the popular smartphones, still requires heat,\na suction cup, and, in the case of the iPhone 13, a software update (which we’re still\nwaiting for) to un-break FaceID. You can learn more about that in our recent\niPhone screen pairing video. It’s almost depressing, thinking about how\ndifferent the world would be if repairing every smartphone battery and screen was this\neasy. Props to Fairphone, for reminding the world\nthat this is possible, and making it look easy. The Fairphone 4 earns a 10 out of 10 on our\nrepairability scale, for it’s modular design, easy access to critical parts, as well as\neasily accessible spare parts and repair information. Just a reminder, a 10/10 doesn’t necessarily\nmean this is a perfect design, though Fairphone has done a tremendous job here. They are leagues ahead of most other smartphone\nmakers. But the buttons and fingerprint sensor are\na bit tricky to access, and, like we mentioned, there are places where Fairphone is trending\ntoward combining parts where it isn’t totally necessary, like the camera and speaker parts. Thankfully, it’s all pretty tastefully done\nfor now. Thanks for watching this teardown, let us\nknow in the comments if you would buy this over an iPhone or a Samsung, if it were available\nwhere you live!",

      "title": "How easy is it to repair the Fairphone 4? - Teardown review",
      "transcript": "hello everyone and welcome to another video today we are tearing down the fairphone 4 possibly the first phone in a very long time that actually wants you to do this that wants you to be able to take components out replace them repair them and own the hardware yourself very excited to see just how easy it is to do this so let's get into it let's get the tear down going and let's answer the question now immediately a great sign is that you can buy the separate components on the fairphone website and from other suppliers as well like I fix it so there's definitely opportunity here let's get it apart and let's see how repairable this thing is okay so let's get into it and actually we're instantly going to have one up on most modern phones the fact that the back just comes off there's a nice little Groove here that you can use to pop the back off it's definitely quite firmly on there but easy enough to get off and here we go straight into the phone and into the second repairability thing which you don't see on many phones and that is the battery just comes out yep the battery is not glued in it's not fixed you can just take it out and you can get a new battery love to see that so we're going to pop that over there as well out of the way and then looking in here we've got a couple of different kind of modules H you can see there's a a bit here with one screw on it that says one and then there's a bigger bit here that says two and that's got a picture of the camera and a speaker so I believe this is one module and then there's another module down here that can come out and presumably this as well interestingly enough uh these are all kind of normal Phillips head screws if that's going to focus but um down here these are hex screws so maybe this bit is not really meant to be user removed but we're going to do it anyway okay so let's do the sensible thing and let's start with taking off the section that says number one and just that one screw it looks like yep that just pops off little bit of plastic protection and you've got some ribbon cables here which I'm guessing are for all the different components that are part of this module so let's just uh get those off there we go so those are all disconnected now and let's go ahead with uh number two and get what looks like these five screws off right with all those off this should now just kind of pop off the cover here yep like that and around this side as well there we go and that's this whole module removed so this is really what I mean about the repairability of this the whole camera module that's all now a separate piece that you could just buy and replace and then in here we've got what looks to be the main board this is the front-facing camera in there but let's continue down the bottom here and take a look at this section so let's get these uh six screws off here and see what's under here okay and so with those screws this should also just pop straight out like that super easy and again this has got I think the speaker on there uh and the vibrating function as well I I think uh so that's all of that just pops straight off very cleanly so I'll pop that to one side as well editor Zachary here if you have made it this far into the video and you're enjoying my content please do hit that subscribe button we are still a very small Channel and 99.1% of you are not subscribed so hit that subscribe button and help me on my journey to 1,000 subscribers thank you very much and back to the video so next up let's take this piece off here like I said these are hex screws as you can kind of see so I think that might be where it's supposed to stop um from a easy repairability point with these modules but let's go deeper and there we go this just comes off again just another plating and yes as you can see the whole kind of PCB runs this whole leg down here as well so that's kind of just securing the main PCB to the inside so the next thing that we can take off here is the USBC Port here it's just got a little ribbon cable and as you can see it's secured by a screw that we've already removed so if I just pop off the ribbon cable you can see the whole USBC module and again super repairable take that and you can get a new one without a problem at all so at the top here we do have have the little camera front faing camera module which again is just secured by ribbon cable so that's come off nice and easily and we've also got uh the loudspeaker here as well also just on a little ribbon cable so again super repairable all these extra small little components that you really can um just deal with and I think at this point the whole board should now be able to just lift out so if we can yep there we go and just like that the whole board is out everything is kind of the component wise is all protected by these shields so there's not much to worry about there but again you could replace the full board if you wanted to so with the main board out all that's really left here is the screen itself and then the actual frame of the device you can see there's some the actual ribbon cable for the screen we're going to leave it there I'm pretty sure if we take these alter screws out as well we can start peeling it apart but I'm not sure if the screen is laminated and as this isn't my phone I have to send this back uh I am going to put it back in one piece and make sure it's working still so there we G it though this is an incredibly repairable phone you can repair replace the battery individual speaker USB camera you've got the back cameras you've got the vibration uh unit and the loudspeaker you've got everything you could want realistically to replace very impressive okay let's get this back together and make sure it works n and there we have it all back together all working just fine great to see just how easy that was wasn't it um loved it okay we're going to wrap it up there for today I hope you've enjoyed this video I I've always enjoyed tearing down Hardware that's kind of something I've done for many years not always successfully put it back together but we've learned and improved so I hope you enjoy this kind of content and I will see you again very soon for another video thank you very much for watching bye for now",

      "transcript": "this is the google pixel 6 disassembly if you want to see more videos like this make sure you like subscribe and click on notification bell so you'll be notified when i upload new videos if you need any tools there are links in the description first the sentry needs to be removed next we need to heat up the front of the phone where the screen is so we can loosen up the adhesive underneath and then we'll need to use some sort of a suction cup tool to help us gain leverage between the screen and the frame of the phone so we can place our plastic pry tool in between and run it along the edges to pry the screen off once the screen's free from the frame lift it up from the right to the left but be careful since the cable for the screen is still attached to the main board there's a metal bracket here covering the connector for the screen which needs to be lifted up and removed and there's a latch on the side so we're going to bypass that by pulling away from the frame now the screen cable can be disconnected the in-screen fingerprint reader is located here and it is adhered to the screen so if you needed to replace this you would have to disconnect the cable over here by lifting up the latch and pulling that cable out and then you have to heat up this area and pry this portion off now i'm not sure if replacement screens will come with this fingerprint reader pre installed but i would hope so since replacing this part might be a little bit difficult since you'll have to read here this part back to the screen there's also a cutout on the top portion of the screen for the proximity sensor here's a better look at that cutout there are also five clips on the plastic border which is attached to the screen and those clips help hold the screen down more securely aside from those clips the adhesive around the screen is pretty strong so prying the screen off was really difficult and took a lot of time to make sure not to damage it there's graphene film here here and here and the graphing film help transfer heat once the graphene film is peeled off there are 9 t4 or torx 4 screws which need to be removed now the mid plate can be removed here's a better look at the mid plate the haptic feedback or linear vibrator motor is located on the back of the midplate next before we continue the battery cable needs to be disconnected the camera cables can be disconnected are two t4 screws holding on the camera assembly which need to be removed now the camera assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that so to remove the battery there's a pull tab provided to help us pry the battery off that didn't really work so this pull tab easily slides out so we're gonna have to actually use some isopropyl alcohol and get some around the edges of the battery and let it sit there for about 30 seconds to a minute so it eats away with adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off here's a better look at the battery there's one more flex cable we need to disconnect and then there are five t4 screws we need to remove on the bottom speaker assembly now the speaker assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that and there's a mesh filter over the speaker opening at this point there is one more t4 screw on the top of the board which needs to be removed once that's removed we can lift up and remove the main board taking a better look at the main board the proximity sensor is located on top there's some graphene film over the shields the sim card reader is located here and the charger port is located on the bottom with a rubber gasket around it now one thing i don't like about this design is the charger port is soldered onto the board so if that were to get damaged it would be difficult to replace and next to that is a primary microphone once the graphene film is peeled back we can see a thermal pad on top of the processor here's a look at the back side of the board there's a single t4 screw holding down the top earpiece speaker once the screw is removed we can lift up and remove the earpiece speaker here's a better look at that there's a rubber gasket around the opening the led flashboard is located underneath and this flex cable connects that flashboard to the main board there's also a secondary microphone on this board and the third microphone on top which is connected by this flex cable on the top right side there's a placeholder for where the millimeter wave antenna would go and there's one t4 screw holding down that placeholder once the graphene film on the back is peeled back it reveals where the wireless charging coil is as well as the nfc antenna there's a square cutout in the metal frame over here and the connector is over here this flex cable also connects the volume keys and power button to the main board so if you want to replace those you just have to pull up on this metal bracket and remove that and then you'll be able to push in the keys and remove them now the glass camera lens cover as well as the glass pieces on the back are held down with adhesive so if you wanted to replace those or remove those you would have to heat them up and pry them off as far as repairability goes i give this phone a 6 out of 10. there is strong adhesive holding the screen down but aside from that screen replacement shouldn't be too difficult however there is more work to take apart the rest of the phone and the fact that the charger port soldered onto the main board that would make charge upper replacements difficult now it's time to put the phone back together once everything's back in place reapply your screen and then power on the phone and you're done i hope you enjoyed the video and i'll see you in the next video",

      "title": "Google Pixel 6 Pro Screen Replacement Repair",
      "transcript": "hey guys today I have a Google pixel 6 Pro the screen is broken and we are going to do a screen replacement as you saw it the fingerprint sensor on this device is still working the fingerprint sensor need to be removed out of the old screen and transfer onto the new screen this is the critical part of this screen replacement this is a pixel 7 Pro and it will be exactly the same thing for that device today I'm not using a heat gun I will be using a hot plate to perform this screen replacement repair after the screen has been heated to the right temperature depending on what tool you use to hit the screen you can insert your guitar pick at the bottom of the device and then start the removal process of the front of the device using a hot plate like this I left the device on the hot plate for about 8 to 10 minutes before I started the removal process the temperature was around 80 degrees Celsius which was good to start the removal process of the screen this is a cyclic process you need to hit the screen a little bit and then grab your guitar pick and separate one side of the screen and the device and do the same thing once again hit the screen of the device and use your guitar pick to separate the screen from the body of the device on the other side since your screen is broken the only valuable thing on the screen is the fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor is glued to the screen you can use a heat gun to separate the screen from the body of the device but make sure that you do not hit the screen and the fingerprint sensor area too long at the highest setting on your heat gun the pixel 6 pro has one screw holding the screen Flex cable after removing that screw and the retaining plate we can disconnect the screen Flex cable from the body of the device to remove the screen pull the screen and flex cable at the same time it is just that easy again this is the pixel 7 Pro the removal process of the screen is exactly the same but in the 7 Pro they didn't have a retaining screw that holds the screen Flex cable connected to the motherboard so back to the pixel 6 Pro Google has designed the fingerprint sensor to be connected to the screen after you pull the little handle that connects the screen to the fingerprint sensor you can remove the part that goes directly to the fingerprint sensor so the fingerprint sensor is disconnected from the screen now after a quick hitting of the fingerprint sensor we can start the removal process of the secret tree of the fingerprint sensor just grab one of your tool that is flat very flat and inserted between the fingerprint sensor Flex cable and the screen of the device pull a little bit in order to start the separation of those two so this part is very important you need to take your time while doing this and hit the front of the device constantly and using your tool to disconnect the flex cable from the body of the screen also do not try to pull vertically with a lot of force because if the back of the screen is not hot enough you risk to damage the fingerprint Flex cable so right now I have separated all the Flex cable from the body of the screen so we just need to remove the fingerprint sensor itself now that is connected to the screen by double-sided tape also so here we need to hit the front of the device once again in order to soften the double-sided tape around the fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor that Google used for the pixel 6 pixel 6 Pro and pixel 7 Pro pixel 7 also is made out of glass and plastic the glass piece is the actual fingerprint sensor if you pull it in the wrong way it can crack and your fingerprint sensor is done I found that the best way to remove the fingerprint sensor is to use a metal tool like the one that I used it is not sharp but it is very flat you go under the fingerprint sensor right on the edge only the edge is safe to go under if you go in the middle it can damage the fingerprint sensor so you go in the edge and separate the fingerprint sensor from the screen and after that you can see the fingerprint sensor is moving a little bit more than it was before I'm sure you're going to be tempted to pull the fingerprint sensor vertically if you do that it is going to get cracked as you just saw it I simply pulled the fingerprint sensor right and left until the double-sided tape has no more strength and removed it so we need to reinstall the fingerprint sensor onto the new screen this is the new screen that I'm going to install on this pixel 6 Pro for the installation make sure that you align the fingerprint sensor perfectly with the square on the screen the square on the screen is going to look directly inside the fingerprint sensor if it is not aligned correctly it might get some false reading while you're trying to use your fingerprint sensor and it is not going to work as it is supposed to I think mine is where it is supposed to so after that we need to connect the fingerprint sensor secretly inside the screen circuit the removal of the fingerprint sensor Flex cable and the reinstallation of that fingerprint sensor Flex cable can be done by hand but if you have a tweezer it is going to help you better the screen is ready now to be tested we need to test the screen before we completely seal the device we need to connect the flex cable of the screen onto the motherboard and apply a little bit of pressure on it to make sure it is completely connected after that we can turn on the device and see if the screen is responding normally one thing that you must do is to go inside the fingerprint sensor setting and register one or two fingers and test if it is working this is very critical if it doesn't work something is wrong with your fingerprint sensor and you might need to buy another fingerprint sensor and recalibrate it so I was even surprised that the fingerprint sensor worked directly without doing anything else just plug and play normally with this device if you change the screen the fingerprint sensor might not work due to compatibility with the screen and all that you will have to go inside the Google software recalibrate the fingerprint sensor to work with your motherboard or recalibrate sync everything together if that does not work there is a problem with the fingerprint sensor and you might want to buy another one and test that one and see if it works so before you reinstall the screen you need to clean the body of the device you need to remove all the old glue all the old double-sided tape that is on the device after that apply a little bit of air to remove all the dust everything out of the body of the device once you've cleaned the body of the device you're ready to install the new screen before installation of the new screen if you have some new double-sided tape you need to install the double-sided tape on the screen if it is not already or install the double-sided tape on the body of the device the screen that I got didn't come with a double-sided tape so I am using b7000 as a sealer b7000 is electronic repair glue that is supposed to seal your device if you do any type of repairs screen replacement or back replacement b7000 works really well I've used it multiple times before after that you need to install the flex cable of the screen onto the motherboard add the retaining plate and the screw when those have been completed close the screen apply a little bit of pressure for the ceiling process start if you have to use b7000 make sure that you do it very fast you apply the b7000 around the device close the device quickly before the b7000 start to get solid so today I'm going to use this small device to apply pressure on the screen for it to seal completely I'm going to leave the device under this press for 10 minutes if you've done everything right after 10 minutes you can remove the device under the press and start the inspection I will have links to all the tools that I use inside this video for you to check out and if you need them you can have them everything went well the screen looks brand new this is a new screen the device has been rejuvenated so the issues that you may have with this screen replacement is mainly the fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor will need calibration if it doesn't work right away 190 dollars for this screen if you go to a shop it is 300 to 400 I think I showed you everything that you need to know about this screen replacement and this applies to the pixel 7 Pro also for a battery replacement on the pixel 6 and pixel 7 Pro pixel 6 Pro also click the video on the screen now",

      "transcript": "this is the google pixel 6a disassembly if you're interested in seeing more videos like this make sure you subscribe and follow me on twitter so you'll be notified when i upload a new video and if you need any tools there are links in the description now before i start the video i just want to say one thing i have no idea if this is an isolated incident or what but this pixel 6a was a brand new unit and i opened the seals on the box myself however when i took a closer look at the back both the camera lens bezel and the back plate are scratched up both have scratches or scuffs on them and there's some dust or debris inside the box so i'm not sure if this would be the case for anyone else here's a closer look and i'm not sure how well the camera will pick up the scuffs or scratches let me know in the comments below if your unit has this type of issue the screen however doesn't have any scratches since it has this protector over it that comes in the box all right let's move on with the disassembly first the sim tray needs to be removed here's a better look at that next we need to apply heat to the front of the phone to loosen up the adhesive underneath the screen and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off now be careful when you're getting your plastic pry tool and you don't damage the screen underneath once the screen is loose from the frame you need to lift it from the right side to the left but be careful since the screen cable is still attached there's a metal cover over the connector that needs to be removed now the screen cable can be disconnected from the main board here's a better look at the screen the plastic housing for the front-facing camera is located on top and there's a plastic frame around the screen this plastic frame also has catches around the sides which in addition to the adhesive around the screen help hold the screen to the frame even though the flex cable for the fingerprint sensor can be disconnected from the screen the sensor itself is adhered or glued to the screen so i'm assuming screen replacements will come with this fingerprint sensor pre-attached the protective film on the bottom by the charger port needs to be peeled off there are 16 t4 or torx four screws which need to be removed the screw sizes are different so make sure to remember where each screw goes now the mid plate can be lifted up and removed there's a large piece of graphite foam over the front of the midplate and the graphite film helps transfer heat the vibrator motor is located on the bottom corner now that we have access to the battery cable we're going to disconnect that first now the provided plastic pull tab can be used to help pry the battery off prying this battery off was much easier compared to the pixel 6 or pixel 6 pro now let's peel off this piece and then we have a better look at the battery which has a minimum rating of 4 306 milliamp hours and the typical rating of 4 410 milliamp hours the bottom speaker assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that and there's a mesh filter over the opening there's a single t4 screw which is holding on the main board that needs to be removed and then the main board can be lifted up and removed taking a closer look at the main board the charger port is soldered onto the main board so making a charger per replacement will be difficult the primary microphone is located right next to it the sim reader is located here there's copper tape on these shields also some thermal paste over this one the proximity sensor is located on top as well as the connectors for the two back cameras and those connectors can be disconnected by just popping them off here's a better look with the removable shields removed there's some thermal gel on these chips and the processor here's a better look at the ram and processor and the raw more storage taking a look at the other side we have a better look at the 12 megapixel ultra wide lens the 12.2 megapixel primary lens and the connector for the 8 megapixel front-facing camera the main camera is the only camera with ois or optical image stabilization and more copper tape on the back shields and there's a red rubber gasket around the charger port once the removable shield on the bottom is removed and the copper tape is peeled off the shields we can see more thermal gel on these chips on the frame itself there's more copper tape which sits underneath the motherboard and there looks to be a cutout on the frame for wireless charging but there's no wireless charging coil there's only the flex cable which leads to an nfc antenna located in the center here's a better look with the graphite film and copper tape peeled off there's your nfc antenna the back plate on the pixel 6a is removable you just have to apply some heat and pry it off you also need to make sure to completely peel off this nfc antenna flex cable or peel off and remove the flex cable from the frame over here so you don't tear it if you're prying off your back plate here's a better look at the plastic backplate and here's the frame itself the top panel and the camera lens convert can both be heated up and pry it off as well the top speaker is held on with some adhesive including the flex cable for it so we need to gently pry that off here's a better look at that it has a red rubber gasket around the opening and there are two locations with the small white foam balls and finally there's a secondary microphone located on top which is attached to the flex cable for the led flash for the repairability score i give this phone a 7 out of 10. now it's time to put the phone back together once everything is back in place reapply the screen power on the phone and you're done i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll see you in the next one",

      "transcript": "in this video I'm going to show you step-by-step instructions on how to replace the screen on the Google pixel 6 Pro to begin the repair we need to heat the edges of the screen I'm going to be using a heat gun for this although you can use a haird dryer to achieve the same effect once you've warmed up that display we're going to use this razor blade to create a gap between the chassis of the phone and the front screen and then pry upwards just enough to create a larger Gap so that we can fit a plastic guitar pick in there and then running that pick along the right hand Edge to pop the screen away from the chassis we'll continue back along the bottom Edge on this right hand Edge to release the top Edge I'm just going to twist the screen a little bit and then again with the door pick to open it up as you can see this screen opens from the left hand side and there's just one Flex cable connecting the screen to the phone to release the connector we need to remove this little metal plate it's held down with a T4 remove the screw and then use some tweezers to lift up the shield grab the screen in your left hand and the phone in your right and then just pull away to release it try and take as much adesive as you can with that because we're going to replace that next it looks like I've been really lucky removing all the adhesive possible apart from this little bit here but just grab it with the tweezers however much is left and begin pulling it it's this nice stretchy elastic sort of adhesive and it's very easy to remove you can see there's a bit of dust build up on the edges of the chassis so I'm just going to take a cleaning brush and make sure that the edges of the phone are real nice and clean if you got some isopropyl alcohol it will be helpful to clean it up with that as well that's going to remove any of the remaining adhesive residue that was left behind and the real purpose of this is to make sure that the new screen secures down as well as possible finally the top ped we'll get rid of the dust and the grime up here and that is literally all the work that you have to do to prepare this chassis the part that I'm using for this repair is a genuine Google Service Pack and it comes with the plastic frame attached screen already as well as the fingerprint sensor but that will need calibrating which I'll explain later unfortunately I wasn't able to get an adhesive seal for it and whilst I've seen people using phone adhesives like t7000 or b7000 for this repair I'm going to use Tessa tape similar to the original adhesive seal to rescure the screen to the phone I'll be using long strips of 5 mm teser tape and then cutting it into the edge of the chass using a single-sided razor blade this part always reminds me of arts and crafts lessons at school with all the cutting and sticking now that we've made up the adhesive seal I'm going to remove these blue plastic films from the back back of the display peel off this bit of masking tape then offer up the screen connector to the motherboard of the phone and then once it's lined up I'm going to use a plastic spider to ensure that it clicks into place nicely we can now attach the shield and secure down that single T4 screw now I'm going to remove the backing peel of the adhesive on all four edges of the device then rescure it into the top of the phone and apply pressure to ensure that it's stuck down on all four of those edges final step of this repair and probably the most important for this one first of all remove the screen protector power off the device and then you need to enter the phone into the fast boot mode which you achieve by pressing and holding the power button and volume down button which you can see with into fast boot mode now then we're going to connect the phone to a PC using the USBC cable and then choose connect device it will come up with a list of the connected devices on the left hand side we're going to choose the pixel 6 Pro choose connect and then we're going to choose install software which is the calibration software it'll do its thing and then tell you that the device software was successfully installed and you can now unplug the device it then tells you to restart the device then once it has restarted we'll go back to settings security and privacy device unlock fingerprint unlock enter the passcode and you'll see this time that it should allow us to set up our fingerprint without any problems once it's added you'll see it in the fingerprint unlock settings tab and then when we lock the phone we can open it up using our Thum print that just about completes the repair of this Google pixel 6 Pro including fingerprint calibration thank you for watching and see you next time",

The part that I'm using for this repair is a genuine Google Service Pack and it comes with the plastic frame attached screen already as well as the fingerprint sensor but that will need calibrating which I'll explain later. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get an adhesive seal for it so I'm going to use Tessa tape similar to the original adhesive seal to rescure the screen. lined up I'm going to use a plastic spider to ensure that it clicks into place nicely we can now attach the shield and secure down that single T4 screw. Then we're going to connect the phone to a PC using the USBC cable and then choose connect device. you that the device software was successfully installed and you can now unplug the device it then tells you to restart the device.

      "transcript": "hello everyone this is Matt from Real World review and today we're going to be replacing the front glass and the front OLED on the Google pixel 6. so the tools you're going to need are going to be a Razer Blade a plastic pick a playing card and some heat you also need some glue as well as some clamps to put the screen down and you'll actually need a cable so you can plug it into the computer to program that fingerprint scanner assuming it works you'll see later so the first thing we're going to do obviously is heat up the screen just get like a kind of Base heat around the screen and what we're going to do is use a razor blade to get under that plastic frame in between the metal frame and use a pick to cut through the adhesive I recommend doing this only if you order the one with the frame and that's exactly what we're going to do here so if you didn't order it with the frame this video might not help with that but ultimately what we're going to do is we're going to go around the edges and cut through the adhesive and lift the screen with the frame out of the phone generally it's pretty easy once you get started the screen does lift over to the left so so be careful a little bit there but what we're going to do is cut through the adhesive around all four of the sides and then we're going to lift it up over to the left like this next we want to grab something that will lift this little screen cover over I use the razor blade but I highly recommend using something like tweezers or maybe something that's made out of plastic since I did use metal it did bend a little bit but you can bend it back to normal then there are a lot of components in here so you want to be careful when you remove the screen but I recommend using the bottom portion and kind of lift it up like this or you can just carefully lift the screen off without anything but again there are a lot of components in here and you don't want to damage any of those so the next thing we're going to do is ultimately remove all the adhesive that's around the edge or at least flatten it to the point where when we apply the glue it doesn't have an uneven coat this isn't really too major if you're using glue like I'm going to but if you're using adhesive I highly recommend making sure that it's flat so then there's no lifted areas but ultimately it's a pretty long process and that glue is kind of stuck on there so you just have to carefully remove it and it will take some time time I recommend using a pick if you have like a sharp edge of a pick but I use a razor blade because it is easier again your ultimate goal is to go around the phone and make sure that the adhesive is either flat or removed if you're going to use adhesive if you're going to use glue again you could just flatten it and it should be fine then the next thing that we're gonna do I did a Google pixel 6 Pro and it came with this but on the Google pixel 6 for some reason it didn't come with a fingerprint scanner so what we're going to do is we're going to heat up the sensor area obviously you want to be careful because you want to just heat up the adhesive and not the actual sensor and use a playing card like this to kind of loosen up that adhesive and you want to go pretty much to where the screen cable is and loosen up that adhesive then you want to carefully unplug it from the phone and it should kind of lift up like this just make sure when you take this off that this sensor is still intact and it's not cracked anyway if it is cracked your fingerprint definitely will not work then the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to remove this little piece for some reason it's in there I don't know why and then we're going to plug in the fingerprint scanner like this so you can kind of line it up properly and it should just line up properly hopefully it works although sometimes it will not work so the way that the fingerprint scanner works is if you buy the screen with the fingerprint scanner attached you can actually program that one with the actual pixel programming website but if you transfer the fingerprint without breaking it obviously you can put that into the new screen and then you won't have to program it at all if it's still not working when you put it on there it's just because you didn't line it up and you have to line it up properly I highly recommend doing this before gluing the screen on just to make sure that you don't mess up and then mine didn't come with this little cover so I'm just going to take this off and set it on the new screen I don't know if it's entirely needed but just in case I'm gonna put it on there and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply a little bit of glue you want to use less than what I did because I did get some on the sensor and I had to take it off but ultimately you want to make sure it's going around the edges so then it's sitting flat and it's not in front of the actual sensor next we want to test the screen to make sure that's working so we want to plug it in we want to put that little cover over the plug and that we can test it and everything seems like it's working fine obviously I can't really test a fingerprint scanner and technically it shouldn't work right now so what we're going to do is we're going to put it over to the side like this apply some glue and then we're going to flip it over a little bit and apply glue on the other side remember this screen does come with the frame so make sure that your screen has that little plastic frame so it keeps everything in place including that front camera everything will kind of click in and you got to set it down just make sure it's fairly flat if there's any glue that leaks out you can clean it up later or if you have any rubbing alcohol you can put some on a paper towel and kind of just clean that off but ultimately what you want to do is you want to put clamps around the corners I recommend putting them on four corners and then two on the middle area like this next you want to let this sit for a couple hours to make sure that the glue dries but in the meantime what we can do is we can try and program that fingerprint scanner so what we want to do is put it into fastboot mode which is volume down and power button while it's powered off obviously and then we can plug it into the computer and then what you're going to do I'm going to leave the link in the description below but what you're going to do is scroll down here and it'll say install fingerprint calibration software and then you want to connect the phone obviously and you want to click connect the phone and it should show up right here you can see it says pixel 6. then we'll click connect and then we can click install software and see where it says downloading software it says couldn't find the unique calibration software for this device that is an actual glitch and I don't really know a way to actually fix this apparently you can do a factory reset though I don't recommend doing that and this is not my personal phone so I'm not going to do that anyway but technically you go through this and it's supposedly supposed to work though I've heard some people saying that you have to run this program a few times successfully to get the fingerprint scanner working so yeah it's kind of a mess and I would kind of assume that your fingerprint's not going to work but if it does work that's pretty awesome either way you want to let this sit for about two hours and then you can take the clamps off and kind of clean up the glue around the screen like I'm doing right now it's pretty easy to take off you can use something like a plastic pick and it should come off fairly easily or you can just use your fingers that also works but that's pretty much it hopefully this video helped you out if you have any questions leave them in the comment section or message me on the social media listed above and as always thanks for watching",

      "title": "Google Pixel 6 Pro Disassembly Teardown Repair Video Review. Can The Parts Be Replaced?? UPDATED*",
      "transcript": "in this video i'm going to be taking apart the google pixel 6 pro also at the end of the video i'm going to be swapping the parts from one phone to the other to see if the parts will work since google may have possibly locked the phones so that they would be the only ones that would be able to replace the parts or repair the phones so we'll take a look at that and see if that's the case and if you want to see more videos like this make sure you like subscribe and click on the notification bell so be notified when i upload new videos if you need any tools i have my affiliate links in the description first the sim tray needs to be removed next we need to apply heat to the front of the phone to loosen up the adhesive underneath the screen and then we're going to use a suction cup tool to gain leverage between the screen and the frame of the phone so we can get our plastic pry tool in between then we're going to run our plastic pry tool around the edges of the screen and pry the screen off just be careful you don't place your pry tool too deep in so you damage the screen or the flex cable once the screen is free from the frame we're going to lift it from the right side to the left side but be careful since the cable for the screen is still attached to the main board there's a single t4 or torx four screw holding on this bracket which is covering the connector for the screen cable once that screw is removed we can lift up and remove the bracket and then we can disconnect the screen cable taking a closer look at the screen there's a plastic frame on the back side and aside from the adhesive there are some catches along the plastic frame which help hold the screen down then display fingerprint reader is adhered to the screen and at the end of the video we'll test to see if we swap the screen of fingerprint reader with a different pixel 6 pro if it'll actually work or not the cable for the fingerprint reader is connected over here and there's a lock or latch which you can lift up and remove that cable i'm pretty sure you'll be able to pry this fingerprint reader off this screen but read hearing a new fingerprint reader to the screen might be difficult also there's a cutout in the screen over here for the proximity sensor here's a better look at that there's graphene film here here and on the bottom and the graphene film help transfer heat we're going to start off by peeling those off there are seven t4 screws holding down the mid plate that need to be removed now the charger part cover and the mid plate can be removed on the back of the aluminum mid plate there's a thermal pad here and here and the linear vibrator motor or haptic feedback motor is located on the bottom there's also liquid damage indicator or this white sticker over here at this point we need to disconnect the battery cable now the millimeter wave 5g antenna cable has to be disconnected there's a single t4 screw holding down the millimeter wave antenna that needs to be removed now we can peel off the flex cable and remove the millimeter wave antenna here's a better look at that there's some gold contacts over here and two on this side over here and this pushes against this since the bottom portion of the battery is sitting over the motherboard we're gonna have to remove the battery before we can lift up and remove the board and to remove the battery there's this pull tab over here provided to help you pull it off i don't know how helpful it will be since on the pixel 6 it will just pull off and slide right out so let's try this first if it doesn't work we're going to use some isopropyl alcohol yep see it comes right out so to make your life a little easier use some isopropyl alcohol and get some around the edges of the battery and let it sit there for about 30 seconds so it eats away the adhesive underneath making it easier to part the battery off and then use this pull tab to help you pry the battery off here's a bad look at the battery and the adhesive underneath the battery is pretty strong there are two t4 screws holding this aluminum cover in place which need to be removed once those screws are removed we can lift up and remove this cover now we can disconnect the three camera flex cables there's a single t4 screw holding down the camera assembly which needs to be removed now the camera assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that this is the 50 megapixel wide lens the 12 megapixel ultra wide and the 48 megapixel telephoto lens there are six more t4 screws which need to be removed now we can remove the top earpiece speaker assembly here's a better look at that and there are some rubber gaskets around the openings the front-facing camera flex cable can be disconnected and removed and the flex cables for the led flash and back ambient light sensor have to be disconnected and finally there's one more t4 screw on the top left corner which is holding down the main board that has to be removed now we can lift up and remove the main board taking a closer look at the main board the proximity sensor is located on top there's graphene film over here on top of the shield the sim card reader is located here and the charger port is located on the bottom and it's soldered onto the board so making charger port replacements won't be that simple the primary microphone is also located next to the charger port and taking a look at the back side there's a secondary microphone located on the top corner so back to the frame we can remove the bottom speaker assembly by lifting it up and pulling it out there's a rubber gasket a mesh filter over the opening of the speaker and here's a look at the bottom there's a square cutout in the middle of the aluminum frame where the wireless charging coil and nfc antenna are and here's the connector for that the flexible power button volume keys is located right here and there's a metal bracket holding them in place so if you want to replace those you have to pull up on this metal bracket and remove that and then you'll be able to push in the keys and remove those underneath this metal plate which is holding down the board that has the led flash on it there's a third microphone which is facing the back side of the phone and this piece over here can be heated up and pry it off it's just held on with some adhesive just keep in mind there's one more flex cable over here which is allowing some adhesive on the frame which is part of this flex cable that leads to that board for the repairability score i give this phone a 5.5 out of 10. the pixel 6 pro was slightly more difficult to take apart compared to the pixel 6 especially when it came to removing the battery since the adhesive was much stronger when it comes to the glass covers on the back they're held down with adhesive so if you have to replace those just apply heat and pry them off okay now it's time to reassemble the phone once all your screws are back in place you're going to apply new adhesive and reapply the screen power on the phone and you're done all right so now what i'm going to do is take one of the screens from the pixel 6 pro and swap it with the other one and see if the display and fingerprint reader will work alright so on this pixel 6 pro it's the original screen and fingerprint reader all right let's set up the fingerprint so now let's unlock it there you go so now let's swap the screens and test that out again i'm going to start off by deleting the fingerprint on the left is the original screen which i marked number one on the right is the other screen from the other pixel 6 pro which are numbered number two so let's pop the other screen on and test it out all right let's unlock it screen's working fine so as you can see it doesn't let us use the fingerprint reader because can't use fingerprint sensor visit a repair provider or gives the website to go to so far not good we now know the fingerprint reader is married to the board so if you're making any screen replacements you are gonna have to pry that old fingerprint reader off and move that over to your new screen and if the fingerprint reader is damaged you're gonna have to probably send it to google to have that replaced next i'm gonna swap the batteries and the cameras and see if those will work all right so now that this battery is in here and other cameras are in there let's power this guy on let's see what happens or the camera seems to be working fine video works fine as well and let's check the front-facing camera and the front-facing camera is working as well as you can see since the screen is lifted up from the frame right now since it's not attached they can see the camera that i'm recording with the battery is also working fine let's plug in the charger so the battery is also charging so there's no issues that i see so now we know the screen battery and cameras can be replaced however the fingerprint reader is married to the main board so from the looks of it that can't be user replaced so you're gonna have to make sure to keep that original fingerprint reader thanks again for watching and i'll see you in the next video",

      "summary": "in this video i'm going to be taking apart the google pixel 6 pro. At the end of the video i'll be swapping the parts from one phone to the other to see if the parts will work since google may have possibly locked the phones. Don't place your pry tool too deep in so you damage the screen or the flex cable once the screen is free from the frame we're going to lift it from the right side to the left side. At the end of the video we'll test to see if we swap the screen of fingerprint reader with a different pixel 6 pro if it'll actually work or not. you'll be able to pry this fingerprint reader off this screen but read hearing a new fingerprint reader to the screen might be difficult also there's a cutout in the screen over here for the proximity sensor. There's graphene film here here and on the bottom and the graphene film help transfer heat. here's a better look at that there's some gold contacts over here and two on this side over here. Since the bottom portion of the battery is sitting over the motherboard we're gonna have to remove the battery before we can lift up and remove the board. Use some isopropyl alcohol to eat away the adhesive underneath the battery. which need to be removed once those screws are removed we can lift up and remove this cover now we can disconnect the three camera flex cables. There's one more t4 screw on the top left corner which is holding down the main board. over here on top of the shield the sim card reader is located here and the charger port is located on the bottom and it's soldered onto the board so making charger port replacements won't be that simple. There's a rubber gasket a mesh filter over the opening of the speaker and here's a square cutout in the middle of the aluminum frame where the wireless charging coil and nfc antenna are. board that has the led flash on it there's a third microphone which is facing the back side of the phone and this piece over here can be heated up and pry it off it's just held on with some adhesive just keep in mind there's one more flex cable over here which is allowing some adhesive on the frame which is part of this flex cable that leads to that board for the repairability score i give this phone a 5.5 out of 10. i'm going to start off by deleting the fingerprint on the left is the original screen which i marked number one on the right is the other screen from the other pixel 6 pro which are numbered number two.and see if the display and fingerprint reader will work alright. If you're making any screen replacements you are gonna have to pry that old fingerprint reader off and move that over to your new screen. have that replaced next i'm gonna swap the batteries and the cameras and see if those will work all right so now that this battery is in here and other cameras are in there let's power this guy on let's see what happens or the camera seems to be working fine video works fine as well.",

      "transcript": "hey guys today I have a Google pixel 6 Pro the screen is broken and we are going to do a screen replacement as you saw it the fingerprint sensor on this device is still working the fingerprint sensor need to be removed out of the old screen and transfer onto the new screen this is the critical part of this screen replacement this is a pixel 7 Pro and it will be exactly the same thing for that device today I'm not using a heat gun I will be using a hot plate to perform this screen replacement repair after the screen has been heated to the right temperature depending on what tool you use to hit the screen you can insert your guitar pick at the bottom of the device and then start the removal process of the front of the device using a hot plate like this I left the device on the hot plate for about 8 to 10 minutes before I started the removal process the temperature was around 80 degrees Celsius which was good to start the removal process of the screen this is a cyclic process you need to hit the screen a little bit and then grab your guitar pick and separate one side of the screen and the device and do the same thing once again hit the screen of the device and use your guitar pick to separate the screen from the body of the device on the other side since your screen is broken the only valuable thing on the screen is the fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor is glued to the screen you can use a heat gun to separate the screen from the body of the device but make sure that you do not hit the screen and the fingerprint sensor area too long at the highest setting on your heat gun the pixel 6 pro has one screw holding the screen Flex cable after removing that screw and the retaining plate we can disconnect the screen Flex cable from the body of the device to remove the screen pull the screen and flex cable at the same time it is just that easy again this is the pixel 7 Pro the removal process of the screen is exactly the same but in the 7 Pro they didn't have a retaining screw that holds the screen Flex cable connected to the motherboard so back to the pixel 6 Pro Google has designed the fingerprint sensor to be connected to the screen after you pull the little handle that connects the screen to the fingerprint sensor you can remove the part that goes directly to the fingerprint sensor so the fingerprint sensor is disconnected from the screen now after a quick hitting of the fingerprint sensor we can start the removal process of the secret tree of the fingerprint sensor just grab one of your tool that is flat very flat and inserted between the fingerprint sensor Flex cable and the screen of the device pull a little bit in order to start the separation of those two so this part is very important you need to take your time while doing this and hit the front of the device constantly and using your tool to disconnect the flex cable from the body of the screen also do not try to pull vertically with a lot of force because if the back of the screen is not hot enough you risk to damage the fingerprint Flex cable so right now I have separated all the Flex cable from the body of the screen so we just need to remove the fingerprint sensor itself now that is connected to the screen by double-sided tape also so here we need to hit the front of the device once again in order to soften the double-sided tape around the fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor that Google used for the pixel 6 pixel 6 Pro and pixel 7 Pro pixel 7 also is made out of glass and plastic the glass piece is the actual fingerprint sensor if you pull it in the wrong way it can crack and your fingerprint sensor is done I found that the best way to remove the fingerprint sensor is to use a metal tool like the one that I used it is not sharp but it is very flat you go under the fingerprint sensor right on the edge only the edge is safe to go under if you go in the middle it can damage the fingerprint sensor so you go in the edge and separate the fingerprint sensor from the screen and after that you can see the fingerprint sensor is moving a little bit more than it was before I'm sure you're going to be tempted to pull the fingerprint sensor vertically if you do that it is going to get cracked as you just saw it I simply pulled the fingerprint sensor right and left until the double-sided tape has no more strength and removed it so we need to reinstall the fingerprint sensor onto the new screen this is the new screen that I'm going to install on this pixel 6 Pro for the installation make sure that you align the fingerprint sensor perfectly with the square on the screen the square on the screen is going to look directly inside the fingerprint sensor if it is not aligned correctly it might get some false reading while you're trying to use your fingerprint sensor and it is not going to work as it is supposed to I think mine is where it is supposed to so after that we need to connect the fingerprint sensor secretly inside the screen circuit the removal of the fingerprint sensor Flex cable and the reinstallation of that fingerprint sensor Flex cable can be done by hand but if you have a tweezer it is going to help you better the screen is ready now to be tested we need to test the screen before we completely seal the device we need to connect the flex cable of the screen onto the motherboard and apply a little bit of pressure on it to make sure it is completely connected after that we can turn on the device and see if the screen is responding normally one thing that you must do is to go inside the fingerprint sensor setting and register one or two fingers and test if it is working this is very critical if it doesn't work something is wrong with your fingerprint sensor and you might need to buy another fingerprint sensor and recalibrate it so I was even surprised that the fingerprint sensor worked directly without doing anything else just plug and play normally with this device if you change the screen the fingerprint sensor might not work due to compatibility with the screen and all that you will have to go inside the Google software recalibrate the fingerprint sensor to work with your motherboard or recalibrate sync everything together if that does not work there is a problem with the fingerprint sensor and you might want to buy another one and test that one and see if it works so before you reinstall the screen you need to clean the body of the device you need to remove all the old glue all the old double-sided tape that is on the device after that apply a little bit of air to remove all the dust everything out of the body of the device once you've cleaned the body of the device you're ready to install the new screen before installation of the new screen if you have some new double-sided tape you need to install the double-sided tape on the screen if it is not already or install the double-sided tape on the body of the device the screen that I got didn't come with a double-sided tape so I am using b7000 as a sealer b7000 is electronic repair glue that is supposed to seal your device if you do any type of repairs screen replacement or back replacement b7000 works really well I've used it multiple times before after that you need to install the flex cable of the screen onto the motherboard add the retaining plate and the screw when those have been completed close the screen apply a little bit of pressure for the ceiling process start if you have to use b7000 make sure that you do it very fast you apply the b7000 around the device close the device quickly before the b7000 start to get solid so today I'm going to use this small device to apply pressure on the screen for it to seal completely I'm going to leave the device under this press for 10 minutes if you've done everything right after 10 minutes you can remove the device under the press and start the inspection I will have links to all the tools that I use inside this video for you to check out and if you need them you can have them everything went well the screen looks brand new this is a new screen the device has been rejuvenated so the issues that you may have with this screen replacement is mainly the fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor will need calibration if it doesn't work right away 190 dollars for this screen if you go to a shop it is 300 to 400 I think I showed you everything that you need to know about this screen replacement and this applies to the pixel 7 Pro also for a battery replacement on the pixel 6 and pixel 7 Pro pixel 6 Pro also click the video on the screen now",

      "title": "HOW TO REPAIR A GOOGLE PIXEL 6 PRO BATTERY - Step-by-step Guide",
      "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to earthbeat i'm going to show you how you can replace the battery on your google pixel 6 and your google pixel 6 pro like most smartphone the first thing that we had to do was to hit the screen of the device to get to the battery you need to remove the screen first for google it is similar to the iphone we need to remove the screen to reach the battery since this is not a screen replacement that's why i'm going fast in the removal process of the battery i have a video dedicated for the screen replacement of the pixel 6 pro you can check that link in the description for the screen replacement and instructions to replace the screen on this pixel 6 pro it is not really difficult you need to hit the front of the device and then use your suction cup to lift the display a little bit and then you insert your guitar pick and run the guitar pick on all four side of the device and then you have separated the screen from the frame of the device the flex cable of the screen is hauled by a retaining plate with one screw you need a set of torx screwdriver in order to perform any kind of work on a pixel 6 and 6 pro the way google had designed this device there is no way you can remove the battery cable without removing the mid frame so we have to remove all the screws attaching the mid frame to the motherboard after we can easily access the mid frame and lift it out of the frame of the device and then we can see the big cable that is the cable of the battery you need to disconnect the cable of the battery first and then disconnect the other flex cable that is very close to the cable of the battery those are the two cables that we need to disconnect at this moment and then we need to clear the area to have the battery exposed without any cable hanging near the battery because we are going to use heat and some tools in order to lift the battery and remove the battery from the frame of the device you might be asking yourself why i'm not using the plastic provided by google to remove the battery because it simply does not work you need to pull on this plastic small plastic but quite solid right and left in order to detach the battery from the double-sided tape it had the pixel 6 and the pixel 6 pro had a lot of double-sided tape and very strong double-sided tape that holds the battery to the frame of the device so what they provided is not going to work and it may even damage your battery i'm going to tell you more on that when the battery is out so a few seconds ago i had heated the back of the device i made sure that i heated the area where the double-sided tape was sitting and i started to pull on the battery at the top of the device the battery was moving a little bit but it was not much so at this point it is better to add some extra heat also if you're going to use a metal tool like you've been seeing me doing it on my other videos for battery replacement you need to have a flat metal tool you must avoid sharp tools because if you puncture the battery you're going to lose that battery and you might eventually create a fire and lose your device and even injure yourself so please make sure that you use a metal tool that is flat and that is not sharp there is one double sided tape at the top of the battery and there is another one at the bottom of the battery but the middle of this battery is where i had the most space where i could insert my metal tool and start to apply some upward pressure i was able to pull the battery slightly from the frame of the device and i was able to insert my secondary tool the plastic tool in blue at the top of the device when that has been inserted it was a little bit easier to pull the battery from the frame of the device so at this point you have created enough space between the battery and the frame of the device to insert your secondary tool and then you can put your flat metal tool near where the double-sided tape is sitting and put some pressure to detach the double-sided tape and the battery together also whenever it gets a little bit too difficult you need to add some extra heat to the back of the device especially where the double-sided tape is sitting so that will help us remove the battery from that area so as you saw it it was very difficult and time-consuming to pull the battery out of the frame of the device google is using some really strong double-sided tape and i have never seen that kind of double-sided tape on any device so if you're doing this take your time to do it and everything is going to be all right the bottom portion of the battery need to be heated the same way that we did the first or the top portion of the battery and then after that you can pull the battery directly from the top but that is a little bit risky because the soft portion of the battery is at the bottom so what you can do is pull the battery from the top a little bit and use one of your tools to cut the double-sided tape but while doing that make sure that you do not puncture the battery and preferably use a plastic tool to do that and then you can start to pull strongly on the battery keep in mind that the soft portion of the battery is still there and then the battery is going to come out of the device to get things a little bit easier you can pull the battery from the top and then add a little bit of alcohol to the bottom portion so that it gets softened and then that will help you remove the battery more easily so let me show you what google wanted you to do with the plastic grab the plastic pull it right and left go through one double sided tape and then go through the other double sided tape the plastic is solid but i think using this method it is going to scratch the battery and it might eventually cut the battery instead of carrying the double-sided tape and the double-sided tape that they use is really really strong to install the battery you need to apply the two double-sided tape that they will provide you either the double-sided tape are going to be already installed on the battery or you will have to install them inside the device once the battery inside the frame of the device make sure that everything is perfectly aligned and then connect the battery cable to the motherboard and then reinstall everything in reverse order that you remove it everything connected including the screen close the device make sure that you apply some pressure on all corners of the device you're going to hear some clicks turn on your device and hopefully it turns on and you can start using your pixel 6 to its full capacity again thank you guys for watching subscribe like and share and i will see you in my next video",

      "transcript": "in this video I'm going to show you step-by-step instructions on how to replace the screen on the Google pixel 6 Pro to begin the repair we need to heat the edges of the screen I'm going to be using a heat gun for this although you can use a haird dryer to achieve the same effect once you've warmed up that display we're going to use this razor blade to create a gap between the chassis of the phone and the front screen and then pry upwards just enough to create a larger Gap so that we can fit a plastic guitar pick in there and then running that pick along the right hand Edge to pop the screen away from the chassis we'll continue back along the bottom Edge on this right hand Edge to release the top Edge I'm just going to twist the screen a little bit and then again with the door pick to open it up as you can see this screen opens from the left hand side and there's just one Flex cable connecting the screen to the phone to release the connector we need to remove this little metal plate it's held down with a T4 remove the screw and then use some tweezers to lift up the shield grab the screen in your left hand and the phone in your right and then just pull away to release it try and take as much adesive as you can with that because we're going to replace that next it looks like I've been really lucky removing all the adhesive possible apart from this little bit here but just grab it with the tweezers however much is left and begin pulling it it's this nice stretchy elastic sort of adhesive and it's very easy to remove you can see there's a bit of dust build up on the edges of the chassis so I'm just going to take a cleaning brush and make sure that the edges of the phone are real nice and clean if you got some isopropyl alcohol it will be helpful to clean it up with that as well that's going to remove any of the remaining adhesive residue that was left behind and the real purpose of this is to make sure that the new screen secures down as well as possible finally the top ped we'll get rid of the dust and the grime up here and that is literally all the work that you have to do to prepare this chassis the part that I'm using for this repair is a genuine Google Service Pack and it comes with the plastic frame attached screen already as well as the fingerprint sensor but that will need calibrating which I'll explain later unfortunately I wasn't able to get an adhesive seal for it and whilst I've seen people using phone adhesives like t7000 or b7000 for this repair I'm going to use Tessa tape similar to the original adhesive seal to rescure the screen to the phone I'll be using long strips of 5 mm teser tape and then cutting it into the edge of the chass using a single-sided razor blade this part always reminds me of arts and crafts lessons at school with all the cutting and sticking now that we've made up the adhesive seal I'm going to remove these blue plastic films from the back back of the display peel off this bit of masking tape then offer up the screen connector to the motherboard of the phone and then once it's lined up I'm going to use a plastic spider to ensure that it clicks into place nicely we can now attach the shield and secure down that single T4 screw now I'm going to remove the backing peel of the adhesive on all four edges of the device then rescure it into the top of the phone and apply pressure to ensure that it's stuck down on all four of those edges final step of this repair and probably the most important for this one first of all remove the screen protector power off the device and then you need to enter the phone into the fast boot mode which you achieve by pressing and holding the power button and volume down button which you can see with into fast boot mode now then we're going to connect the phone to a PC using the USBC cable and then choose connect device it will come up with a list of the connected devices on the left hand side we're going to choose the pixel 6 Pro choose connect and then we're going to choose install software which is the calibration software it'll do its thing and then tell you that the device software was successfully installed and you can now unplug the device it then tells you to restart the device then once it has restarted we'll go back to settings security and privacy device unlock fingerprint unlock enter the passcode and you'll see this time that it should allow us to set up our fingerprint without any problems once it's added you'll see it in the fingerprint unlock settings tab and then when we lock the phone we can open it up using our Thum print that just about completes the repair of this Google pixel 6 Pro including fingerprint calibration thank you for watching and see you next time",

The part that I'm using for this repair is a genuine Google Service Pack and it comes with the plastic frame attached screen already as well as the fingerprint sensor but that will need calibrating which I'll explain later. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get an adhesive seal for it so I'm going to use Tessa tape similar to the original adhesive seal to rescure the screen. lined up I'm going to use a plastic spider to ensure that it clicks into place nicely we can now attach the shield and secure down that single T4 screw. Then we're going to connect the phone to a PC using the USBC cable and then choose connect device. you that the device software was successfully installed and you can now unplug the device it then tells you to restart the device.

some glue as well as some clamps then you obviously need a computer to change the fingerprint scanner which may or may not work you'll see what I mean so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to heat up the edges of the screen just get a decent amount of heat so then we can loosen up that adhesive and we can get under the screen and kind of lift it up like this but pretty much what you're going to do is use a razor blade lift up the screen just a little bit and then use the pick to cut through the adhesive this is definitely more difficult than the pixel 6 and it will take a little bit more heat and a little bit more patience so definitely proceed with caution obviously if your screen is crack like mine you definitely want to use some eye protection to make sure you don't get any glass in your eyes but you can see I'm using either the pick or a pling card to cut through the adhesive and just keep doing that until you go around the entire screen if you're trying to preserve the OLED this most likely will break it so definitely consider that once all the edges are lifted up it does lift up to the left side so make sure to set it up like this and then we're going to grab that T4 driver and we're going to remove that screw right here and use a pick to lift up the little retaining clip right here next you want to carefully remove that screen I recommend using the pick on the bottom portion like I did on the six and for some reason I used it in a different area on this one but either way I recommend using the bottom to lift up that cable and now the screen is no longer attached so like I said here's the screen that I ordered it comes with the fingerprint scanner and all the plastic frames that go around the camera as well as the screen I highly recommend getting this one and not one without any of those but in the event that you do order just a screen like that you can pretty much just loosen up this adhesive and remove it from the actual screen itself and then kind of set it into the phone like this obviously you want to use some glue to set it in but it is possible to do that it's definitely more difficult to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to remove the adhesive from the screen this is actually really easy it's like a stretchy adhesive that sits on the actual phone so we can just carefully remove that and that should remove all the adhesive that goes around the screen and if you needed to remove the fingerprint scanner you just want to heat it up like this just a little bit and cut through the adhesive around the edges then you want to just lift up the cable and unplug that cable and then what you would want to do is plug it into the a new screen like this and you can either set it down if the adhesive is still good or you can use some glue around it just make sure you don't get any of the glue on the sensor itself but either way we're going to use the new screen with a new frame so we're going to test this first we're going to plug it in like this and make sure that the phone powers on looks like it does touchcreen seems to be working button seems to be working so that's good we're going to power the phone off and then we're going to apply some adhesive right here I recommend using just glue but we are going to put some adhesive as kind of a little buffer to make sure that that plastic isn't touching directly onto the metal though that shouldn't entirely matter but I'm also putting adhesive just on the sides I'm not putting any on the top then I'm going to use the glue around the rest of the phone so what we can do is we can plug in the screen we can put that little retaining clip and then put that T4 screw back in again we want to test make sure the screen's working and then we can grab that glue and we can apply it on the side on the bottom on the right right side and on the top then what we're going to do is just push down on the screen make sure it's kind of flat and we can clean up the little excess glue that there is going to be pretty much you just want to get like a paper towel and either clean it up or add a little bit of rubbing alcohol on it and remove it that way you can always wait until the screen kind of cures and then you can remove it by hand that's an option as well then what we're going to do is put the clamps on I recommend putting them on all four corners and then two on the side like this and then what we're going to do is we're going to let that sit for about 2 hours then you can program the fingerprint scanner in the meantime but what I did is I let it sit for 2 hours I'm removing these clamps and I'm going to clean up the adhesive like this all I'm doing is just using a finger or fingernail and I just want to make sure that it does work so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the computer and I'm going to put the phone into fast boot mode and plug it in and to do that all you want to do is turn off the phone hold volume down and power button and you'll see this menu like this next what we want to do is we want to go onto the link that I have in the description below and what you want to do is scroll down to where it says install fingerprint calibration software and you want to click connect phone and on the top left it should say pixel 6 Pro you click connect and then click install software and it should start working if it shows up like what it says on here couldn't find the unique calibration software for this device this is actually a software glitch or Hardware glitch depending on how you look at it and ultimately there's no way that you can fix it as far as I know I've heard that you can do a factory reset and this should help that issue but I don't recommend doing that unless you have all your information backed up because it may or may not even work so the way that the fingerprint scanner works is if you buy the screen with the fingerprint scanner attached you can actually program that one with the actual pixel programming website but if you transfer the fingerprint without breaking it obviously you can put that into the new screen and then you won't have to program it at all if it's still not working when you put it on there it's just because you didn't line it up and you have to line it up properly I highly recommend doing this before gluing the screen on just to make sure that you don't mess up but ultimately you want to run this software and supposedly it works though I've never had success with this you can try multiple times but most of the time when it says this it's not going to work but if it does work it should should go through and restart your phone and the fingerprint scanner should work though if it's still not working you want to just run this program again apparently it does take two or three times to work but once that's programmed that's about it hopefully this video helped you out if you have any questions leave them in the comment section or message me on the social media listed above and as always thanks for watching",

      "title": "Attempting an iPhone 13 Pro Screen Replacement.. Is it easy?",
      "transcript": "so apple released the iphone 13 series today and i'm really wondering how hard a screen replacement would be on this phone because the internals are all different it's a different process but is it a harder one let's find out so because there are no parts available for this phone i have another iphone 13 pro and i've taken off the screen and removed all the parts so we're going to be simulating a screen replacement and seeing exactly how hard this is first things first we're going to unscrew so apple use the same pentalobe screws they always do no surprise there unscrew the second one so because i've already opened up this phone the adhesive is weak but i'm still going to heat it up just to make sure because the screen is extremely thin and i feel like a lot of people are going to break it when they're trying to fix it now the screen is nice and hot it is time to open this up we're going to stick our jimmy tool in now this tool is the best for these kind of phones i found it to be the most useful the gap is really really small this year so it is hard to get in there okay so for whatever reason it's harder than normal what we're gonna do is grab a suction cup and we're just going to use it to get some leverage there we go now we're inside the phone we're going to loosen up that adhesive with a pry tool i'm using my nails because they work a lot better there we go we're going to turn off the device so my last video my audio quality was so bad i apologize for that guys it's kind of a race to to get these things opened up and i didn't want to fall behind because of poor audio so we're gonna open it up okay so our screen is being held up by our little tool here and we're going to need to remove a few brackets so we have to remove these screws there's one two three and we have to remove this entire bracket so one two three four these two are phillips so be careful so we're just gonna unscrew that one and this one as well we can remove this bracket so this is our battery connector we want to remove this first so there's absolutely no power going to the phone so we're just gonna remove that i unclipped it with my nails uh you should do it with a plastic spudger but i have more success doing stuff with my nails if you guys watch my videos you already know that so we're also going to disconnect the screen which is this flex cable here now we have to remove this bracket so unscrew and unscrew again now we're going to switch to a phillips screw screwdriver and we're just gonna unscrew and we can remove this plate now we have to remove the front uh i keep saying front ear piece speaker but they actually change things up the front earbud speaker is not part of the phone so i guess this is just the proximity sensor and probably a microphone and a couple other things so we're gonna disconnect that and now we can take off the screen so this would be the broken screen if we were to do the screen replacement so we have to transfer over this module which i guess as i said is a microphone proximity sensor and probably something else so it looks like there's only three tri-point screws there so we're going to grab our tri-point screwdriver and we're just going to unscrew we're going to unscrew the second one and unscrew the third one now we can take off this bracket and there we go that is our microphone proximity sensor and i don't know what that is yet but we'll find out i don't recommend you doing this repair if you just started fixing phones this seems a little bit more advanced just because of how small and thin this flex cable is and if you rip anything here you'll probably end up damaging face id and you'll need another one of these which aren't even out yet so anyway we're going to get started so the first thing we're going to do is just add a little bit of heat to the back side of the screen not the front now we're going to take our jimmy tool again this is my favorite tool i use it for everything and we're slowly and gently going to just wiggle it and try and get under this thin flex there we go so i recommend avoiding this area because um of those gaps there you could easily cut that cable then you need a new one and that won't be good especially not now okay so again i'm just being as patient as humanly possible there we go so we have this part off pull that out now comes the tricky part so okay so we're going to add just a little bit more heat you don't add any alcohol to this because it could seep into the screen in case you need it so we're just going to going to pry up on the microphone first there we go there we go now comes the hard part so this is quite hard to get out i'm not too sure what it is yet but we'll find out very soon so apply from here and slowly pull it up definitely don't apply from there because that cable is way too thin again you don't want to pry from there at all it's just not a good idea okay now we can pull this out and it looks like it might be a proximity sensor i'm not too sure yet so we're going to put the screen aside and we're going to grab our new screen and we're going to place this back ideally you should be putting more adhesive but there is enough residue that it'll stick down so it goes back on pretty easily now we're gonna put that shield back on i don't know if this is easier than the other screen replacements feels about the same difficulty but i think it's easier to break this component than it was before so we're now going to take the phone and we're going to take the screen we're going to reinstall it we're going to reinstall everything there we go we're going to reconnect the battery and we're going to test it to make sure everything's working so the phone booted and there's no face id warning or anything so looks like we're good to go one thing i will mention is the cameras are really awkward they make repairing this phone really weird the phone never sits flat which is i don't know it just doesn't feel right we're going to re-screw and screw the second one in take our phillips screwdriver okay so we got all the screws in we're going to get that crunch get that crunch so that is an iphone 13 screen replacement um it's not that hard i mean it's it's a little difficult you'll probably end up damaging this i i don't recommend that you do this especially if it's still a new phone because you could easily damage the screen or this but um yeah it's really not the hardest thing in the world honestly the iphone 7 was probably harder to replace than this but it's just a lot less expensive this screen is probably worth around six or seven hundred right now so definitely do not recommend doing this yourself if you don't know what you're doing but yeah thank you guys so much for watching um i hope you enjoyed these videos sorry about the bad audio quality in the last one don't forget to like subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one",

      "transcript": "you're watching the Google pixel 5A disassembly if you want to see more videos like this make sure you like subscribe and click on notification Bell so you'll be notified the next time I upload a video and if you need any tools there are links in the description to start off this entry needs to be removed now heat needs to be applied to the front of the phone where the screen is to loosen up the adhesive underneath and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off now the screen can be lifted up towards the left side at which point there's a metal bracket over here covering the connector for the screen as well as a T4 screw over here or a Torx screw which is holding that metal bracket down that needs to be removed once that bracket or cover is removed we can disconnect the screen cable so taking a look at the screen there's a plastic frame bordering it which has multiple clips around it to ensure a secure seal there's also of course the adhesive water resistant seal around it and if you're to get a replacement screen which didn't come with this plastic border around it this plastic border is just held on with some adhesive to the screen so all you have to do is apply heat and pry it off and reapply it with new adhesive to your replacement screen there's a large graphing film over here which needs to be peeled off and the graphene film basically helps transfer heat there's another plastic cover over here which needs to be removed foreign once the plastic cover is removed and this protective tape is peeled back there are two hidden T4 screws there are 10 T4 screws which need to be removed when you're removing the screws keep a track of which screw goes where since some of the screws are in different lengths now that the screws are removed we can remove the metal bracket or cover over the charger port now the metal cover over the motherboard can be removed there's also a small plastic bracket which goes over here in the corner on this metal cover there's a flex table over here with a notification LED on top on the other side we can see the connector for that Flex cable over here these two gold contacts which make contact with the two points on the motherboard giving its signal there is also a vibrator motor over here on the bottom corner at this point we have access to disconnecting the flex cable for the battery there are two adhesive pull tabs provided to pry the battery off one is located over here on top and one over here on the bottom the bottom one doesn't happen to be a pull tab just some protective tape and I guess in general the pull tab is pretty useless since it tears when you try to pull it so instead we're gonna have to use some isopropyl alcohol and get some around the edges of the battery and let us sit there for about a minute so it needs to lay out the adhesive underneath making it easier to pry off okay here's a better look at the battery the 12.2 megapixel dual pixel and 16 megapixel Ultra wide lens can be disconnected by just popping off the connectors here's a better look at those cameras we can proceed to disconnect the rest of the cables the headphone jack cable can be disconnected and removed there is also a liquid damage indicator which is why it's thicker on the headphone jack there are three more T4 screws which need to be removed and then finally the motherboard can be lifted up and removed foreign there is another plastic bracket over here which goes on the corner by the speaker assembly so when you're reassembling it don't forget to put that piece in so taking a look at the motherboard we have the SIM card reader located right over here there's copper tape over here on top of the shield the proximity sensor is located over here on top and the primary microphones located over here on the bottom the charger port is soldered onto the board so making repairs on the charger port would be difficult there's also a red rubber gasket around the charger port there's also another liquid damage indicator located right next to the primary microphone which is that white sticker there's a white coaxial cable connecting the speaker assembly to the bottom of the motherboard which we're going to disconnect right now and that can be disconnected by just popping It Off once the shields on this side are removed there are some rubberized thermal pads or thermal paste on top of the processor RAM and the chip over here here's a better look at it with the thermal pads removed on the back side of the motherboard we can see more copper tape on top of the shield over here there's also a coaxial cable running over it and the front-facing camera connectors over here and there's a protective tape over here covering it that can be disconnected by just peeling off the tape and popping off the connector once the bottom Shield is removed and the copper tip is peeled back we can see some more thermal pads over here on top of these chips the flex cable for the volume keys and power button is over here and it's rather along the edges over here there's a metal bracket over here holding them in place which can be slid up and removed the fingerprint reader is located right over here and the flex cable is right underneath this Flex cable and it comes over here the flex cable for the camera flash is located right over here and it's routed underneath this metal cover which is held out with two T4 screws once that metal cover is removed you can lift up and remove that Flex cable the Erp speaker is located here on top at an angle and it's held down with adhesive so if you wanted to replace that you just have to gently pry it off also once I remove the battery I noticed there are two more pull tabs over here underneath on the bottom portion of the battery which are somewhat hidden but in reality these pull tabs are terrible because they're easily tear when you try to pull it off so applying isopropyl alcohol made it much easier to pry the battery off there's more grafting film over here covering that NFC antenna and there's a water resistant mesh filter over here for the microphone opening here's a better look at the speaker assembly there's a water resistant mesh filter over here covering the opening and underneath this white sticker over here there are the small white foam balls those help the speaker sound louder once the graphite film is peeled back we can see the cutout or opening in the housing where the NFC antenna is now I don't know why they didn't include wireless charging on this phone since they already did a cutout for the NFC antenna they could have just made it larger and added a wireless charging coil as far as repairability goes I give this phone a 5 out of 10. the screen replacement will be easy but aside from that it'll be more difficult to replace other parts now I'm going to go ahead and put the phone back together once everything's back in place apply new adhesive and replay your screen power it on and you're done thanks again for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video foreign",

      "title": "Xiaomi Mi 11 Teardown! - Lets find that battery...",
      "transcript": "so i'm a huge fan of this xiaomi 11 color scheme it's got the subtle glow you'd get by lighting a robin's egg on fire seems like only cheaper phones get the cool colors these days we're going to take apart this new xiaomi mi 11 and see what that 50 watt wireless charging looks like from the inside let's get started once again in order to get inside of this glass back smartphone we have to break out the heat gun the me11 does not have an official ip rating but it is still glued together pretty tight the hotter the phone gets the easier it is to remove the glass there's a little sweet spot where the adhesive gets loose it's right there between being barely too hot to touch and the battery exploding with a little upward pulling motion on my suction cup i can slip my pry tool and razor blade in to slice away that soft adhesive and as you can see with a little more heat the back can literally pull right off with the panel gone we get our first look at that wireless charging pad it's only got one large copper circle i was curious to see if there might have been multiple since 50 watts of wireless is pretty extreme we'll get a closer look in a second there are nine screws holding down the top plastics and camera lens these screws are all tinted green except for the ones around that camera these are different sizes so i'll keep them separate and organized because like always it's nice when the phones survive the teardown and i can get it all put back together with the camera lens unplugged we can see that it's actually made from metal underneath cnc'd aluminum we can tell by the machining marks on the back and underneath the glass layer on top it's got a dual colored led flash next i can lift off the wireless charging coil and the nfc pad it's impressive that this guy can handle 50 watts of wireless charging and 10 watts of reverse wireless most phones can only do about half of that we can see little strands of copper inside that generate the magnetic field that allows it to send and receive power i'll unplug the two battery connections and the two extension ribbons all unclipping like little legos i was curious to see how xiaomi could manage all of the power coming into this phone and it looks like the battery is indeed divided into two separate parts the adhesive under the battery is also pretty chill nice work xiaomi thumbs up for that and even though it appears to be one solid battery it's still got the two plugs which makes me think that all the charging juice is being divided between two cells and since it's like two batteries being charged at the same time it charges faster pulling double the normal power it's cool to see what solutions different companies come up with a tesla for example has about 6000 batteries and can absorb power pretty fast when all charged at the same time the bottom speaker is held in place with seven screws still the same little green guys i'll link the toolkit i'm using in the video description with the wires unplugged from the speaker it comes free from the phone and we can check it for balls and indeed underneath the little sticker are thousands of foam sound dampening balls these help the speaker sound bigger than it actually is the balls give the speaker more surface area inside for the sound to resonate off of there's also waterproofing on the speaker unit itself kind of fun i'll remove the dual sim card tray along with both long extension ribbons and then we have access to the charging port board with its white water damage indicator near the usb-c port which also has a black rubber ring around the opening that black rubber though isn't the only water protection down here by the square vibrator and the speaker opening we get another waterproof mesh with its own rubber seal the mi 11 might not have an official ip rating but it still does have protection against water let's move up to the top of the phone so we can check out the cameras the front facing hole punch camera can pop out of the phone it's 20 megapixels and does not have any optical image stabilization which is pretty normal i'll unplug the other two smaller cameras on the back and remove one remaining screw holding the motherboard down then that board can lift up and out of the phone exposing the liquid cooling vapor chamber that xiaomi mentioned and also quite a bit more copper on the back side of the board from here i can unplug the large 108 megapixel camera sensor and we get access to all three rear cameras the bottom ultra wide 13 megapixel sensor does not have ois but the large 108 megapixel sensor in the center does the optical image stabilization is pretty important on a main camera then we have the 5 megapixel macro camera off to the side which does not have ois with the front screen having super small bezels the proximity sensor which is the little guy that turns off the screen when it's next to your face is hidden under the display just like an optical fingerprint scanner and it sits there right next to the earpiece speaker finally let's get a look at this liquid cooling or the vapor chamber basically these have some form of liquid or gas inside that helps facilitate the transfer of heat the hot gas or liquid inside gets pushed away from the hot processor then the thin mesh wicks it back to the center after it cools down so it can repeat the cooling process sometimes we can visibly see liquid droplets inside of this vapor chamber but not this time around depending on the gas used it could have evaporated instantly when it's cut open so i'm not too worried plus copper would do a good job of conducting heat all by itself the underscreen fingerprint scanner is tucked between the frame and the screen which means it probably does not have a lens and might be why it wasn't the best at reading my fingerprint after i scratched it it's just a flat sensor doing all of the work in order for us to see it though i would have to destroy the screen and since the screen is the best part of the phone we're just gonna leave it in peace overall i like what i see xiaomi made a beast of a phone and slapped a fair price on top i'm still not totally sure if they're allowed in the usa at the moment our government has been erratic for quite some time but things will start settling down soon with the battery back in place and both of its connectors plugged in i can get the wireless charging pad back on top along with the aluminum camera housing and all of the screws that hold the whole thing together it's time to see if the mi 11 survived the teardown and indeed it has let's hope 2021 is the year of normal price cell phones again i think that would be a win for everyone another win for everyone would be hitting that subscribe button if you haven't already and come hang out with me on instagram and twitter thanks done for watching i'll see you around",

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, Welcome back to geardo, Today we will show you how to replace the charging \nport flex on the Xiaomi Mi11 LiteMobile phone. To start, we need to have the right \ntools to proceed with the repair,   which You can find in the description. First, turn off the phone, take out the Sim \ntray, and then follow the back cover removal. To remove the back cover, it needs to heat gently   around the rear cover edges until \nthe pasted adhesive becomes soft. For this, we are using a heating \npad. Place the back cover side on   the heating pad and Select the mobile \nphone HEATING option and leave it till   it completes. Alternatively, you \ncan use a heat gun or hairdryer. Once the heating has completed,   Use a suction cup to create an opening \nbetween the frame and rear cover. Next,   insert a plastic card pry tool or something \nsimilar to cut the adhesive around the back cover. Take out the rear cover and remove the Logic \nboard frame by undoing 11 screws. And then   disconnect the battery plug on the left-hand side \nand sim connector plug on the right-hand side. Next, move to the bottom part and undo \nfour screws to take out the sim card flex.   And then undo three more screws to \ntake out the speaker buzzer module. Next, disconnect the main ribbon flex.

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Max Abandoned &amp; Unclaimed By Owner - So I Fixed It For Myself",
      "transcript": "foreign six months ago I was given this iPhone 12 Pro Max that had been found on the side of a highway it was badly smashed on the front and had two cracked camera lenses even though it was abandoned I was able to track down its original owner through the SIM card we texted called and even went as far as contacting a place he used to work but after six months he didn't get back he must have really hated this phone to have thrown it out a window at 100 kilometers an hour having made all the attempts to return it and waiting a considerable amount of time it's clear it was abandoned on purpose so what else can I do well I might as well try and fix it while the screen is dead I did manage to erase it and since finding the phone iCloud has been switched off so it activates fine leaving some glimmer of hope for this poor phone once the two bottom screws are removed I can pry up the obliterated display I have opened up this phone before but had forgotten just how bad it really is in case you didn't see the original video the phone had been left abandoned for several days on the side of the road I know this as the person who picked it up said he initially saw it a few days prior and didn't stop as such the insides have filled with water and mud leaving small amounts of rust over several screws most of this will have entered from the two cracked camera lenses while we already know this phone Powers up we don't know whether it has any other hardware issues so before attempting anything else I want to test a new display on the phone to make sure it can output an image if it can it means we can further test the phone to determine whether there's any other issues we need to fix besides the obvious for our new display I'll be using a best quality aftermarket soft OLED display I haven't gone for a OEM or refurbished display as the cost is too great I don't want to take that much of a gamble with this damaged phone after plugging in the charger we get our first positive sign the phone lights up on boot the Apple logo turns to a black screen what I thought was the phone shutting itself off was actually just the phone sending itself to zero percent brightness with a quick flash of normal brightness levels after a press of the power button I'm really hoping this isn't some logic board issue but it wouldn't be an iPhone repair without a few error messages one for face ID and the cameras not being genuine but more importantly the screen brightness still isn't working even worse is I've now found a new error message one I've never seen before an Apple pay issue has been detected what does it mean we'll have to figure that out later but first we need to fix this screen brightness issue I gave the phone a reboot to see if that would fix the issue it boots on full brightness until reaching the lock screen where all brightness controllers last one thing I believe the issue could be is a result of not attaching the earpiece cable this houses the light sensor for adjusting screen brightness because I was still testing I attached the sensor cable without removing it from the old screen and this fixed the issue we now have an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a working display the two out of the three rear cameras don't work sound works but not vibration face ID says it's detected a problem and has disabled itself and we have a nice long list of unknown parts and issues listed in settings the phone is going to take quite a bit of work to get back into a usable state it might not end up perfect but if we can save it I'll be happy down at the charge port I'm going to replace the dead vibration motor the first step of course being to remove the layer of dirt on top of everything that's going to be a common theme as we progress with this repair I want to make the internals look more presentable we need to take care when removing the rusty screws as they have a high chance of stripping if you don't apply enough downward force on the screw when you remove it with the vibration motor out it's time for a clean underneath before it's out with the old and in with the new I don't know about you but these rustier screws don't look very good so let's fix that with a little vinegar using my spudger and dipping it in the vinegar I could transfer it to the Rusted areas it didn't take long before I could start scraping away at the rust while using a blunt plastic sponge it worked for some of it I found using a tiny wire brush made these screws look a lot better than what they did there was quite a number of screws around the device that looked very similar to these ones at the charge port so I slowly went around applied vinegar and scraped away the rust with a wire brush after which the internals were starting to look a lot cleaner up at the top it's time to get the rear cameras replaced after the bracket is removed the cameras can be unplugged and attached from the phone have a look at that I think there's more dirt than there is cameras they're also supposed to have slight movement to help stabilize each lens it's so clogged that they can't even move cameras are really finicky and in this state it's a replacement fix because there's no coming back from this level of damage at this stage I'll also remove the front-facing camera as it needs to clean along with the upper internals of the phone before installing the new cameras we first need to replace the two smashed camera lenses this is much easier than replacing the back glass all you need to do is pry out the broken glass and given that it uses a reasonable amount of adhesive this can be done with relative ease once the glass is removed I can simply clean out the old adhesive apply some new adhesive and the new camera lenses I brought this pack of three lenses for about four dollars so it's a cheap and easy fix though I would recommend always taking the camera out first while looking for replacement parts I found this it claims to be able to remove the non-genuine camera messages for the iPhone 10r through 12 Pro Max first I wanted to try an iPhone 10s Max camera it says to attach the wide angle lens which didn't even plug into the connector on the programmer so I tried another camera but nothing was detected and the camera just got really hot so I tried the camera from this phone and again nothing in fact I tried several more cameras with the same result this thing doesn't seem to work I later found out that even if I was able to read the camera I would have had to solder a special new flex cable to the replacement camera which I didn't have so we're just gonna have to put up with the non-genuine messages for our new camera though it's looking fine so it's time to get it installed into the iPhone 12 Pro Max I of course can't forget to clean the camera bracket before installing it on top of the cameras the face ID module in this iPhone according to the phone itself is faulty but as Apple are the only ones able to replace it there's nothing I can do but clean it up and hope for the best as any Replacements will cause issues and still won't work as it's encrypted and programmed to the phone but face ID is also connected with the earpiece cable if one or the other doesn't work or is replaced face ID is lost as part of any iPhone 12 screen replacement you must transfer the earpiece cable to the new display panel using some heat from a heat plate can help aid its removal this cable happens to have some corrosion and maybe one of the reasons face ID doesn't work but again as it's paired to the phone I can't replace it even if I wanted to this is because of replacement still wouldn't bring back our face ID so as long as the earpiece and proximity sensor works I might as well just keep the water damaged unit for our new display panel I'll be using this aftermarket soft OLED panel which will give us the best quality without having to Spring out for a genuine screen which is several hundred dollars more expensive this screen was under a hundred dollars so for a water damaged phone that's never going to be quite perfect I think I picked the perfect option it's time to test fit our display and give the phone a good test to make sure our new replacement parts are functional and there's no other issues with our iPhone 12 Pro Max powering up the phone we can see we've got display brightness the cameras are working and same with the vibration motor so with our phone working it's time to get it sealed up I'll first need to remove all the old adhesive around the perimeter this is by far the hardest and most time consuming step of the entire repair it was so stuck I even tried adhesive remover however it just turned it into a gooey mess eventually I was able to pick up the adhesive and remove it in my usual fashion by Rolling it around my tweezers once clean I could attach the new seal if you look closely this is actually a seal for an iPhone 14 pro Max I'm putting this on as the CLI purchased for this iPhone 12 was canceled it fits perfectly fine with only one small modification needed to the top before we get the screen installed I think it's time for a good comparison on how we found the internals and what they look like now quite a big difference it's hard to believe this is the same phone with that it's now time to get the display attached for the final time once its two connections have been attached the upper bracket can be fastened into place before attaching the battery and the last remaining bracket finally I can remove all the plastic film starting with the one on the back of the display followed by the adhesive strips around the perimeter of the frame now the display can be pressed into the frame sealing the two halves together after installing the two pentalobe screws into the bottom of the iPhone 12 Pro Max the last thing we need to do is remove the plastic protective film and we're done so this is it an abandoned iPhone 12 Pro Max that has been resurrected from the dead I truly didn't think this phone would still be working after all the damage is sustained but I was proven wrong that being said the phone isn't perfect the face ID error cannot be fixed and there's a logic board issue affecting the use of Apple pay but those are issues that will affect functionality don't prevent the phone from being used meaning we've successfully saved this phone from becoming e-waste and on that note this has been a Hugh Jeffries video if you like what you saw consider subscribing and check out the phone restoration

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Max Teardown",
      "transcript": "Hi everyone, Welcome to How-Fixit, in this\nvideo I will disassemble the iPhone 12 Pro Max and together let's see what's inside this\nsmartphone and compare it with the iPhone 12 Pro. In the description under the video, I left\nlinks to disassemble of all iPhone 12 models. By the way, This video is for overview purposes\nand doesn't include the assembly process. If you need complete instruction with reverse\nassembly, in the description you will find links to a playlist with step-by-step instructions\non how to repair iPhone 12 Pro Max. What tools need to disassemble the iPhone\n12 Pro Max: HowFixit screwdriver set\nTweezers Plastic mediator\nPlastic tools and Suction cup for removing display\nIn the description, I left links to all the necessary tools. The disassembly process doesn't differ from\nprevious models. Still need to remove the two screws near the\ncharging port using a 0.8mm Pentalobe screwdriver. To open the case, it is enough to warm up\nthe display surface even with an ordinary hair dryer for 3 minutes at a temperature\nof 70-80 degrees Celsius. The case of the iPhone 12 Pro Max opens like\na book, that is, turn the display to the left. The display module in iPhone 12 Pro Max is\nthe largest and thinnest of all previous generations of iPhones. In the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the telephoto camera\nhas a better optical zoom than the iPhone 12 Pro. You can see Differences in the sizes of the\ncamera modules when comparing. So, the Pro Max camera module is larger than\non the 12 Pro. Сamera lens is slightly larger and because\nthis zoom is better. The \nbottom speaker is very easy to remove. No more adhesive tape or ribbon cables. If you compare the size of the speaker case\nto the iPhone 12 Pro, you can see that on the Pro Max the bottom speaker is slightly\nlarger. The  Taptic Engine in the iPhone 12 Pro Max looks\nlike the vibration motor from the iPhone 12 mini. Compared to the 12 Pro, you can see that the\nmodule a little bigger. Let's move on to the battery. It is glued to the back housing with silicone\nadhesive tapes, nothing new here, and now we will remove them. I love these sounds, and I love when these\nsilicone tapes tear By the way, in the upper part of the battery\nthere is absolutely no place to pull this tape at a convenient angle, of course there\nis a higher risk that this tape will tear. iPhone 12 Pro Max comes with the largest battery\nat 3687mAh. This is 872mAh more capacious battery than\nthe 12 Pro. Comparing these batteries, there is a clear\ndifference in size, but this is not surprising. The Face-ID module is the same as before,\nalso has an infrared camera, a dot projector and a front camera. All the same as on previous iPhones. The \nSIM card reader in iPhone 12 Pro Max remains a separate module from the motherboard and\ncan be quickly removed and easily replaced. This ribbon cable is connected to the back\nof the motherboard, you cannot disconnect it because it is soldered to the board. You can find this cable on all iPhone 12 Pro\nMax motherboards, but only for the US market. IPhone 12 Pro Max for the Asian and European\nmarket does not have such a ribbon cable on the motherboard. So why is this cable here? This ribbon cable directly connects the motherboard\nto the 5G millimeter-wave antenna module (mmWave). In the iPhone 12 Pro Max model A2342 (for\nthe US market), the 5G mmWave antenna module is built into the side of the smartphone backhousing\nand this is how it looks. On the outside of the backhousing, this matte\narea under the power button, this is window for the 5G mmWave antenna. Another antenna module is located on the back\nof the motherboard. What does it all mean? All iPhone 12 models support 5G bands sub\n6 Ghz and in the iPhone 12 for US market with 5G mmWave module gives an additional 2 bands\nn260 and n261. So, this mmWave is a set of 5G frequencies\nthat gives ultra-fast speeds at short distances, making it best suited for dense urban areas. These are light sensors and now located on\na separate cable. And now we got to the LIDAR scanner. This sensor improves the quality of photo\n(especially in low light conditions). Also with this sensor, the iPhone makes measurements\nin space more accurately. It's great that this sensor is separate from\nthe camera module. The ribbon cable with the diode is very easy\nto remove and, if the diode is damaged, it can be easily replaced. Let's see what's left on the back housing. In the lower part - cable with a lightning\nconnector, in the upper part there is an antennas. In the middle of the case there is a wireless\ncharging module and now it has a magnetic ring. 18 small neodymium magnets are located along\nthe edge of the wireless charging coil under this black film. So, no more surprises from Apple, iPhone 12\nPro Max teardown is complete. In the description I left links to all instructions\nfor the all iPhone 12 models. That's all, you were on HowFixit, and see\nyou next time.",

To open the case, it is enough to warm up the display surface even with an ordinary hair dryer. a temperature of 70-80 degrees Celsius. The case of the iPhone 12 Pro Max opens like a book, that is, turn the display to the left. The display module in the Pro Max is the largest and thinnest of all previous generations of iPhones. iPhone 12 Pro Max comes with the largest battery at 3687mAh. This is 872mAh more capacious battery than the 12 Pro. Face-ID module is the same as before, also has an infrared camera, a dot projector and a front camera.

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Max Teardown! - I&#39;ve NEVER seen this before...",
      "transcript": "today it's time to take apart the new iphone 12 pro max apple's latest and greatest most powerful iphone and also the largest iphone that's ever been made with supposedly a new trick inside that we've never seen before i kind of broke the last iphone i took apart so cross your fingers this one survives let's get started so the iphone 12 pro max is basically just a larger version of the iphone 12 pro with apple releasing four new iphones this year it does get a little confusing all you really need to know though is that the pro max has a larger screen larger battery and some slightly better cameras which is what we are after today if you remember last time i was trying to remove the screen i accidentally pried up underneath the glass instead of under the plastic frame and broke the display this time i'm making sure to lift the screen up high enough that i can get underneath the plastic part of the display with my pry tools since the screen is recessed this is much harder than it looks the reason we want to check out the camera units inside of the macs is because apple has engineered a new form of image stabilization that we've never seen inside of a smartphone before it's called sensor shift and can stabilize an image at over 5 000 times a second so if this is true it's actually pretty huge and a pretty big step forward in the mobile camera game as we can see my screen is still working so far thumbs up for that we're off to a good start there are four screws holding down a metal plate over the battery connector and screen ribbon once that's off i can unplug the battery like a little lego and then move to the second metal plate that covers the other ribbon connector it also has four screws once that's removed i can unplug the remaining screen ribbon and detach the display from the body not too shabby the cameras are all under this other metal plate but first let's take out the battery usually apple's pull tabs are kind of fun but not so much this time around all of the magical pull tabs keep on breaking but with a dab of isopropyl alcohol the stickiness underneath the battery dissolves and i can pry the battery out relatively easily the alcohol is non-conductive and evaporates pretty quickly so it doesn't hurt the electronics but still battery replacements could be easier now we can see what the pull tabs are supposed to be doing if we could actually grip them as they stretch theoretically they lose their stickiness and just pull right out from underneath the battery just not this time around now it's time to check out apple's latest innovation in mobile camera technology i know we don't always use apple and innovative in the same sentence but here we are and it's actually pretty impressive so inside the 12 pro max the top camera is the telephoto which does have optical image stabilization where the lens does the moving the wide angle is off the side with no ois and the main sensor is at the bottom and it looks like it does not have ois since the exterior lens is not moving but that's actually not the case the main camera has that sensor shift we talked about earlier which is actually much better and much cooler than regular ois but first let's grab the main camera lens out of the regular iphone 12 pro so we can compare them the regular size 12 pro has its main sensor at the top instead of the bottom the telephoto and main sensor locations are reversed between the two phones but that's not super important all of the cameras are very securely glued into a metal housing so they can work seamlessly with one another when the phone switches camera perspectives popping the camera module out from the housing is difficult but still possible remember we're still working with the normal iphone 12 pro at this point not the max just yet once the main camera is out i can start opening up the camera module this kills the module but if phone carnage made you queasy you probably wouldn't be subscribed like you are right now i can break open and peel away the metal housing surrounding the camera lens and the camera sensor you can see that the camera lens floats over the top of the sensor like a hoverboard from back to the future the top lens is wiggling to compensate for and stabilize the shakes that happen to the phone while you're taking a picture or video this type of ois can stabilize at about 1 000 times a second which is impressive but not quite as impressive as what's inside of the max taking a look at both camera housings we can see that the iphone 12 pro max is indeed quite a bit larger than the iphone 12 pro optical image stabilization has been a big deal for flagship smartphones for the past few years however professional real size cameras like this gh5 sometimes have a type of stabilization that is called sensor shift it's an internal stabilization method that moves the sensor itself to stabilize the image instead of moving the exterior lens it's much faster since it happens right at the pitcher collection point the sensor this technology has only been found in dslrs until now apple says they've included this sensor shift technology on the iphone 12 pro max it's on the largest sensor of the grouping and is just as difficult to get inside of as the regular iphone 12 pro but pretty much anything is possible with the razer blade i'm actually pretty excited to get inside of this one seeing brand new technology from the inside is why we're here once the back metal is off we get our first look at the bottom side of the camera sensor and it is indeed shifting moving around inside of the housing while the exterior lens stays in the same spot it looks like apple has indeed done it they've done something new i'll pop the camera lens off so we can see how it works apple says that instead of the normal 1000 adjustments per second that we see with regular ois this new sensor shift method can stabilize up to 5000 times per second which is a pretty big deal and means we get quite a bit more accuracy the camera lens portion of the housing has several large magnets and when i say large i mean the size of an ant but still proportional to the camera it's pretty big these magnets sit on top of tiny coils that can ever so slightly shift the position of that sensor the sensor shifts around inside of its housing just like we saw on the professional camera and at 5000 times a second it happens pretty fast of course the sensor of the max is a tiny bit larger than the iphone 12 pro which we can see now that they are side by side this means that the larger sensor on the max can absorb a tiny bit more light which is a good thing the pixel size themselves are also 0.3 micrometers larger on the max than they are the regular i'll let other reviewers be the judge of the actual camera image quality but if you want the best of the subtle camera improvements the iphone 12 pro max is where apple has put everything they've got i'll get the phone reassembled to make sure i don't break it this time around well break the important parts you know what i mean the phone should still work without the rear camera modules installed once the battery is plugged in and the metal plates are back in place the phone does indeed turn back on which is a good thing breaking two iphones in a row would have been kind of embarrassing with the cameras missing the camera app does still open up but just doesn't find anything to show us kind of interesting if you think it's fun to see the insights of high-tech technology but also enjoy things like water resistance warranties and your phone still working you might like my teardown skin it's an exact representation of what's inside of your smartphone while keeping all the important bits covered i'll have to update the sensor shift portion around the camera lens because it looks pretty cool but yeah i'll put a link for the teardown skin down in the video description we're covering more than 60 devices now so we probably have one for whatever phone you're using if you're curious about the large wireless charging coil or the ring of magnets you can check out my full iphone 12 pro tear down video where i explain all of that i'll leave a link for that in the description as well i think apple's done a good job this year let me know what you think of the sensor shift technology down in the comments and come hang out with me on instagram and twitter thanks done for watching i'll see you around",

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, Welcome to How-Fixit, in this\nvideo I will disassemble the iPhone 12 mini and together we see what is inside the smartphone. In the description under the video, I left\nlinks to the disassembly of all iPhone 12 models. This video is for overview purposes and doesn't\ninclude the assembly process. If you need complete instruction with reverse\nassembly, in the description you will find links to a playlist with step-by-step instructions\non how to repair iPhone 12 mini. What tools need to disassemble the iPhone\n12 mini: HowFixit screwdriver set\nTweezers Plastic mediator\nPlastic tools and Suction cup for removing display\nIn the description, I left links to all the necessary tools. The iPhone 12 mini disassembly process doesn't\ndiffer from previous models. Still need to remove the two screws near the\ncharging port using a 0.8mm Pentalobe screwdriver. To open the case, it is enough to warm up\nthe display surface even with an ordinary hair dryer for 3 minutes at a temperature\nof 70-80 degrees Celsius. The case of the iPhone 12 mini is glued well\nenough and you have to pull hard on the suction cup ring. But as you can see, it is really possible\nto open the iPhone 12 mini, even with a regular hair dryer. The case of the iPhone 12 mini opens like\na book, that is, turn the display to  the left. Compared to previous generations, this display\nmodule looks very thin. The camera module of the iPhone 12 mini is\ncompletely the same as on the iPhone 12. The technical specifications and size of the\nmodule are the same. In the description, I left a link to the test\nof interchangeability of modules between all the iPhone 12 models. Now the bottom speaker is not glued to the\ncase and replacement process is much easier. And the speaker case is smaller than on the\niPhone 12, and therefore the sound will be slightly quieter (it will be noticeable against\nthe background of low frequencies) There are also differences when comparing\nthe Taptic Engine of iPhone 12 mini with the dimensions of the module in the iPhone 12. The Face-ID module is the same as before,\nalso has an infrared camera, a dot projector and  a front camera. On the iPhone 12 mini's battery is smaller\nthan the iPhone 12. The battery capacity is 2227mAh and compared\nto the iPhone 12 - the battery life on iPhone mini is 17% shorter. This cable is connected to the back of the\nmotherboard and if you peel off this protective film, you can see that this cable is soldered\nto the board. You can find this cable on all iPhone 12 motherboards,\nbut only for the US market. iPhone 12 for the Asian and European market\ndoes not have such a ribbon cable on the motherboard. So why is this cable here This ribbon cable directly connects the motherboard\nto the 5G millimeter-wave antenna module (mmWave). In the iPhone 12 mini model A2176 (for the\nUS market), the 5G mmWave antenna module is built into the side of the smartphone backhousing\nand this is how it looks. On the outside of the backhousing, this matte\narea under the power button is the window for the 5G mmWave antenna. Another antenna module is located on the back\nof the motherboard. What does it all mean All iPhone 12 models support 5G NR ranges\nand this 5G mmWave module in the iPhone 12 for US market gives an additional 2 bands\nn260 and n261. So, this mmWave is a set of 5G frequencies\nthat gives ultra-fast speeds at short distances, making it best suited for dense urban areas. Light sensors are located on a separate cable. The ribbon cable with the diode is very easy\nto remove and, if the diode is damaged, it can be easily replaced. Let's see what's left on the iPhone back housing. In the lower part - cable with a lightning\nconnector, in the upper part - antennas. In the middle of the case there is a wireless\ncharging module and now it has a magnetic ring. The magnets are located along the edge of\nthe wireless charging coil. There are 18 small neodymium magnets glued\nhere and they hold well. So, no more surprises here, iPhone 12 mini\nteardown is complete. In the description I left links to all instructions\nfor the all iPhone 12 models. So, guys, that's all, you were on HowFixit,\nand see you next time.",

      "transcript": "hi guys i am vadim you are on variam24.com youtube channel and today i will comment and you will watch the video on how to disassemble apple iphone 12 mini disassembly has a third difficulty or heart rating in our difficulty classification and will be disassembled by detaching the display model i guess it will take up to 30 minutes let's get started first of all we unscrew two screws on the end of the phone and set them aside we use a pentalobe screwdriver aka a 5 point or 5 point star 0.8 millimeters there are many names for the screwdriver but we will use pentalobe when we disassemble any device from the apple brand it's exceptionally important to pull the unscrewed screws remove brackets and antennas in the right order therefore we need to take care of this beforehand and prepare a table or a flat surface and it's also so critical to remember the location of everything because there are a lot of screws and they are of different sizes and shapes it's easy then remembering to take a picture of your steps during disassembly and probably the last rule i would call it slowly but surely do not rush anywhere one mistake and you can pierce the board with a long screw or tear off the flat cable so do it carefully we preheated the display surface to the 70 celsius degree or 158 fahrenheit and used a heating mat you can use a hair dryer or heat gun in this model the motherboard is located on the other side unlikely the previous models and this can be seen from the location of the side buttons and the sim card tray now we're trying to pry under the display with a plastic sheet and we do it gently also we use a little isopropyl alcohol usually people use a suction cup to open the display but we will try not to use it here we managed to lift one edge of the display a little it will be easier or farther we pass carefully along the edge try not to push the instrument far not to damage the flat cables beneath also when we open the smartphone the display cable will stretch connectors are affixed by brackets and we need to be careful to not to cheer anything so now we have opened a little and we need to open the upper part but it doesn't want to open and we still go through the upper part with the plastic sheet so hold it gently and open it and let's try to understand how wide we can open the display now we will support the display and start unscrewing the screws seem that one screw hold the first bracket and we need a screwdriver for this step we use a three 3-win y 3-0 aka three-point for triangular slotted screw um our screwdriver has a head size of 2.0 millimeters do not forget to spread the screws correctly on the place you chose for that we see a complex bracket with the clips that we need to lift up and carefully pull it out okay now with the same screwdriver unscrew more screws now the technician forgot to disconnect the battery connector at this point and continue disassembling but you must do this right now to avoid a possible short circuit we remove the bracket securing the connectors and now a specialist disconnect the battery connector with a metal tool which is incorrect we know many examples when a short circuit occurred at this moment so be careful and use a plastic tool disconnect the connectors and it will allow us to remove the display now guys i would like to add one special sprite of the connector with tweezers he didn't catch the connector itself but the rectangle area around it thereby avoiding the possible short circuit but we shouldn't risk disconnect the connectors and probably will try to remove the front camera assembly to do this we need a screwdriver phillips 1.5 millimeters or hash 3o to unscrew the screws remove the rear camera bracket and here we still need to disconnect the cable and remove the camera models first the rear cameras and then the front cameras model and face id we disconnect a few more connectors and peel all the cables from the board okay we take an injection tool open the sim card tray and take it out it's better to do this before starting disassembly and avoid possible problems unscrew two more screws and remove the taptic engine bracket you can disconnect the vibration motor or taptic connector tool we take a special screwdriver call it the iphone phillips 2.5 millimeters it's a phillips screwdriver cross head but with a thin tip used for large screws back in the days only apple had the screws but if i'm not mistaken we will add such a screws to the wheat warning models yeah i guess so i'm sure other companies may follow it now we need a screwdriver three wing y three o to unscrew the screws and remove the bracket that holds the motherboard so the board cannot be disconnected and apparently the sim holder locates on the board so we need to unscrew another large screw with an iphone philips 2.5 meter screwdriver if we recall the iphone 12 pro disassembly where the cable went under the board and went to the far lower corner of the case and the 4g chips has located on it and then it is better to be smart and unscrew and remove everything around the board to the maximum slowly but surely okay another drilling y 3 0 screw take out the taptic engine aka vibration motor i know apple loves it exclusive names but in the end just a quite good and functional vibration model so now we need to press the ejection mechanism of the cartridge that is doesn't interfere with us getting the printer circuit board and we can take out the board but the motherboard doesn't hold anything and you can put it aside now we will detach the lower part where the charging port is located here we need to remove slightly the old sealant layer it won't be worse because we will glue the display back when reassembling using a new sealant now we take out the loudspeaker we're trying to get close to removing and we'll probably continue to unscrew the screws and the same screwdriver phillips 1.5 millimeters so we need to remove the bracket and unfortunately the specialist did it behind the scene but i know it was slightly stuck using a iphone phillips screwdriver 2.5 millimeters unscrew the three large screws technicians call them barrels now because of shape and form shape now our screws two screws securing the charging port to the inner side with a phillips 1.5 millimeter screwdriver now unscrew two more screws but these secure the antennas unit i guess we unscrewed everything and now we will try to remove remove it gently peel off the flat cable pull it gently and you can use another tool such as pudger do do here the cable is thinner at the end is a microphone so you need to be extremely careful in this place we see many parts on the flat cable such as the antennas lighting port and microphones now let's move to removing the battery and as we can see one take has already been turned off and it means that the phone was disassembled before us and your experience might be different uh also as you can see the battery was glued back badly we will have to clean the surface from the old glue and use a new special kit to glue it back properly we will not disconnect anything else we can see the cables for the side buttons flashlight antennas uh remain them in place okay and now we're done it's a pleasure to be with you guys again thank you for watching you guys remember the drill watch like or dislike subscription comment and see you the next video hi guys thank you for watching if you want to see more video like this please subscribe share rate us and see you in the next

      "title": "iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Screen Replacement Repair Guide",
      "transcript": "this iphone 12 mini perfect on the outside but the screen is completely shattered damaged and unresponsive let me show you how you can fix this like for any screen replacement today we need a heat gun to hit the front of the device after hitting the front of the device with the screen heated if your screen is not badly cracked you can use a suction cup to pull the screen out of the frame of the device and after that you insert a tool in to widen the gap between the screen and the frame of the device use your heat gun every time you have some resistance while removing the screen the flex cables are on the left of the screen you need to be very careful while inserting your guitar pick on that area especially the flex cable for the face id and other components attached to the front of the screen do you see these cables that is the cables that i was talking about so for the iphone 12 mini we need to open the device from right opening to the left after opening the device make sure that you support the screen because of the flex cables after that you have to remove two retaining plate one in the middle and the other one at the top of the device now we just need to remove the flex cable of the battery and after that we can proceed in removing the flex cable screen flex cable one in the middle and the other one is at the top connected to the motherboard we have completed the first step in this iphone 12 mini screen replacement carefully remove the broken screen out of the device after that we need to remove all the remaining glue all the double-sided tape that is still attached inside the frame of the device once we have removed all that we can start working on the new screen we need to transfer the earpiece out of the old screen onto the new screen and to do that we will be removing four screws two on the top and two at the bottom so this is a critical part you need to take your time in removing the earpiece because it is made out of some really tiny flex cables you have the big piece flex cable but this attached with some really thin flex cable and it is very small it is critical to hit the front and then you can grab the part and start to pull on it very slowly do not use excessive force because you risk to damage the flex cable and as you can see it it is very tiny and you know probably why they made it that small if you accidentally break anything on this your face id is gone and there is no way to recover it the reinstallation is practically the same thing you need to insert a smaller piece of flex cable and sensors first and then push the earpiece to its final position after that you can insert all the four screws that you removed very important put the screws to their original position and do not over tight any of these screws and make sure the flexible on the left of the camera hole is not pinched after installation give it a final inspection and we can move to the installation of the new screen we need to connect two flex cables one at the top of the device on the motherboard and the other flex cable need to be attached in the middle of the phone to the motherboard depending on the position installation and connection of this flex cable can be a pain you just need to have the right position to connect all these modal flex cables everything has been connected we can check the screen and make sure that it is a fully functional screen and if the touch screen is responding this is the standard notification that apple pushed to scare you after you change a component inside your device so the origin of the screen does not matter the screen installed on this device is an apple original screen that was taken out of the device on the left so after a screen repair we do not have true tone torton has been disabled after doing a screen repair face id is fully functional after doing a screen replacement on this iphone 12 mini the brightness also does work automatically it has not been disabled apart from the true tone everything else is working perfectly as opposed to what was happening when this device just came out after screen replacement you need to replace the double-sided tape that goes between the new screen and the frame of your device to install the double-sided tape you need to remove the screen out of the device disconnect all the flex cables that are coming from the screen and work on the frame of the device only for a perfect double-sided tip installation a lot of power come with the double-sided tape already installed on the back of the new screen so if you have one of those you do not need to do this and you can proceed in the installation of the screen directly let's connect all the flex cables and add the retaining plate and then we can proceed into the final step to complete this screen replacement i will have into the description all the tools and part that you need to complete this repair while closing out the device you can hear some clicking sounds it means that the screen is fully seated on the frame of the device after that we need to reinsert the screws that we removed and if your device does not turn on after you complete a repair on an iphone try the charging cable and if that does not work there is something wrong and you need to troubleshoot your device on that thank you guys for watching subscribe like and share and i will see you next time",

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Max Abandoned &amp; Unclaimed By Owner - So I Fixed It For Myself",
      "transcript": "foreign six months ago I was given this iPhone 12 Pro Max that had been found on the side of a highway it was badly smashed on the front and had two cracked camera lenses even though it was abandoned I was able to track down its original owner through the SIM card we texted called and even went as far as contacting a place he used to work but after six months he didn't get back he must have really hated this phone to have thrown it out a window at 100 kilometers an hour having made all the attempts to return it and waiting a considerable amount of time it's clear it was abandoned on purpose so what else can I do well I might as well try and fix it while the screen is dead I did manage to erase it and since finding the phone iCloud has been switched off so it activates fine leaving some glimmer of hope for this poor phone once the two bottom screws are removed I can pry up the obliterated display I have opened up this phone before but had forgotten just how bad it really is in case you didn't see the original video the phone had been left abandoned for several days on the side of the road I know this as the person who picked it up said he initially saw it a few days prior and didn't stop as such the insides have filled with water and mud leaving small amounts of rust over several screws most of this will have entered from the two cracked camera lenses while we already know this phone Powers up we don't know whether it has any other hardware issues so before attempting anything else I want to test a new display on the phone to make sure it can output an image if it can it means we can further test the phone to determine whether there's any other issues we need to fix besides the obvious for our new display I'll be using a best quality aftermarket soft OLED display I haven't gone for a OEM or refurbished display as the cost is too great I don't want to take that much of a gamble with this damaged phone after plugging in the charger we get our first positive sign the phone lights up on boot the Apple logo turns to a black screen what I thought was the phone shutting itself off was actually just the phone sending itself to zero percent brightness with a quick flash of normal brightness levels after a press of the power button I'm really hoping this isn't some logic board issue but it wouldn't be an iPhone repair without a few error messages one for face ID and the cameras not being genuine but more importantly the screen brightness still isn't working even worse is I've now found a new error message one I've never seen before an Apple pay issue has been detected what does it mean we'll have to figure that out later but first we need to fix this screen brightness issue I gave the phone a reboot to see if that would fix the issue it boots on full brightness until reaching the lock screen where all brightness controllers last one thing I believe the issue could be is a result of not attaching the earpiece cable this houses the light sensor for adjusting screen brightness because I was still testing I attached the sensor cable without removing it from the old screen and this fixed the issue we now have an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a working display the two out of the three rear cameras don't work sound works but not vibration face ID says it's detected a problem and has disabled itself and we have a nice long list of unknown parts and issues listed in settings the phone is going to take quite a bit of work to get back into a usable state it might not end up perfect but if we can save it I'll be happy down at the charge port I'm going to replace the dead vibration motor the first step of course being to remove the layer of dirt on top of everything that's going to be a common theme as we progress with this repair I want to make the internals look more presentable we need to take care when removing the rusty screws as they have a high chance of stripping if you don't apply enough downward force on the screw when you remove it with the vibration motor out it's time for a clean underneath before it's out with the old and in with the new I don't know about you but these rustier screws don't look very good so let's fix that with a little vinegar using my spudger and dipping it in the vinegar I could transfer it to the Rusted areas it didn't take long before I could start scraping away at the rust while using a blunt plastic sponge it worked for some of it I found using a tiny wire brush made these screws look a lot better than what they did there was quite a number of screws around the device that looked very similar to these ones at the charge port so I slowly went around applied vinegar and scraped away the rust with a wire brush after which the internals were starting to look a lot cleaner up at the top it's time to get the rear cameras replaced after the bracket is removed the cameras can be unplugged and attached from the phone have a look at that I think there's more dirt than there is cameras they're also supposed to have slight movement to help stabilize each lens it's so clogged that they can't even move cameras are really finicky and in this state it's a replacement fix because there's no coming back from this level of damage at this stage I'll also remove the front-facing camera as it needs to clean along with the upper internals of the phone before installing the new cameras we first need to replace the two smashed camera lenses this is much easier than replacing the back glass all you need to do is pry out the broken glass and given that it uses a reasonable amount of adhesive this can be done with relative ease once the glass is removed I can simply clean out the old adhesive apply some new adhesive and the new camera lenses I brought this pack of three lenses for about four dollars so it's a cheap and easy fix though I would recommend always taking the camera out first while looking for replacement parts I found this it claims to be able to remove the non-genuine camera messages for the iPhone 10r through 12 Pro Max first I wanted to try an iPhone 10s Max camera it says to attach the wide angle lens which didn't even plug into the connector on the programmer so I tried another camera but nothing was detected and the camera just got really hot so I tried the camera from this phone and again nothing in fact I tried several more cameras with the same result this thing doesn't seem to work I later found out that even if I was able to read the camera I would have had to solder a special new flex cable to the replacement camera which I didn't have so we're just gonna have to put up with the non-genuine messages for our new camera though it's looking fine so it's time to get it installed into the iPhone 12 Pro Max I of course can't forget to clean the camera bracket before installing it on top of the cameras the face ID module in this iPhone according to the phone itself is faulty but as Apple are the only ones able to replace it there's nothing I can do but clean it up and hope for the best as any Replacements will cause issues and still won't work as it's encrypted and programmed to the phone but face ID is also connected with the earpiece cable if one or the other doesn't work or is replaced face ID is lost as part of any iPhone 12 screen replacement you must transfer the earpiece cable to the new display panel using some heat from a heat plate can help aid its removal this cable happens to have some corrosion and maybe one of the reasons face ID doesn't work but again as it's paired to the phone I can't replace it even if I wanted to this is because of replacement still wouldn't bring back our face ID so as long as the earpiece and proximity sensor works I might as well just keep the water damaged unit for our new display panel I'll be using this aftermarket soft OLED panel which will give us the best quality without having to Spring out for a genuine screen which is several hundred dollars more expensive this screen was under a hundred dollars so for a water damaged phone that's never going to be quite perfect I think I picked the perfect option it's time to test fit our display and give the phone a good test to make sure our new replacement parts are functional and there's no other issues with our iPhone 12 Pro Max powering up the phone we can see we've got display brightness the cameras are working and same with the vibration motor so with our phone working it's time to get it sealed up I'll first need to remove all the old adhesive around the perimeter this is by far the hardest and most time consuming step of the entire repair it was so stuck I even tried adhesive remover however it just turned it into a gooey mess eventually I was able to pick up the adhesive and remove it in my usual fashion by Rolling it around my tweezers once clean I could attach the new seal if you look closely this is actually a seal for an iPhone 14 pro Max I'm putting this on as the CLI purchased for this iPhone 12 was canceled it fits perfectly fine with only one small modification needed to the top before we get the screen installed I think it's time for a good comparison on how we found the internals and what they look like now quite a big difference it's hard to believe this is the same phone with that it's now time to get the display attached for the final time once its two connections have been attached the upper bracket can be fastened into place before attaching the battery and the last remaining bracket finally I can remove all the plastic film starting with the one on the back of the display followed by the adhesive strips around the perimeter of the frame now the display can be pressed into the frame sealing the two halves together after installing the two pentalobe screws into the bottom of the iPhone 12 Pro Max the last thing we need to do is remove the plastic protective film and we're done so this is it an abandoned iPhone 12 Pro Max that has been resurrected from the dead I truly didn't think this phone would still be working after all the damage is sustained but I was proven wrong that being said the phone isn't perfect the face ID error cannot be fixed and there's a logic board issue affecting the use of Apple pay but those are issues that will affect functionality don't prevent the phone from being used meaning we've successfully saved this phone from becoming e-waste and on that note this has been a Hugh Jeffries video if you like what you saw consider subscribing and check out the phone restoration

      "summary": "foreign six months ago I was given this iPhone 12 Pro Max that had been found on the side of a highway it was badly smashed on the front and had two cracked camera lenses even though it was abandoned. I was able to track down its original owner through the SIM card we texted called and even went as far as contacting a place he used to work but after six months he didn't get back he must have really hated this phone to have thrown it out a window at 100 kilometers an hour. The phone had been left abandoned for several days on the side of the road. The insides have filled with water and mud leaving small amounts of rust over several screws. Before attempting anything else I want to test a new display on the phone to make sure it can output an image. black screen what I thought was the phone shutting itself off was actually just the phone sending itself to zero percent brightness with a quick flash of normal brightness levels after a press of the power button. I'm really hoping this isn't some logic board issue but it wouldn't be an iPhone repair without a few error messages. cable without removing it from the old screen and this fixed the issue we now have an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a working display the two out of the three rear cameras don't work sound works but not vibration face ID says it's detected a problem and has disabled itself and we have a nice long list of unknown parts and issues listed in settings. It might not end up perfect but if we can save it I'll be happy down at the charge port I'm going to replace the dead vibration motor. The internals of the iPhone 6 are starting to look a lot cleaner up at the top. It's time to get the rear cameras replaced after the bracket is removed. I think there's more dirt than there is cameras. finicky and in this state it's a replacement fix because there's no coming back from this level of damage at this stage I'll also remove the front-facing camera as it needs to clean along with the upper internals of the phone before installing the new cameras. We first need to replace the two smashed camera lenses this is much easier than replacing the back glass. plug into the connector on the programmer so I tried another camera but nothing was detected and the camera just got really hot. I tried the camera from this phone and again nothing in fact I tried several more cameras with the same result this thing doesn't seem to work. Even if I was able to read the camera I would have had to solder a special new flex cable to the replacement camera which I didn't have. with the earpiece cable if one or the other doesn't work or is replaced face ID is lost as part of any iPhone 12 screen replacement.

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Teardown",
      "transcript": "Welcome to How-Fixit and in this video we\nwill take apart the iPhone 12 Pro. If you are interested in iPhone 12 disassembly\nprocess, I left a link in the description under the video. This video is for overview purposes and doesn't\ninclude the assembly process. If you need complete instruction with reverse\nassembly, in the description I left a link to a playlist with step-by-step instructions\non how to repair an iPhone 12 Pro. What tools I will use to disassemble the iPhone\n12 Pro: How-Fixit screwdriver set\nTweezers Plastic mediator\nPlastic tools and suction cup for removing display In the description, I left links to all the\nnecessary tools. Opening the iPhone 12 is the same as usual,\nstill need to unscrew the two Pentalobe screws. To open the case, it is enough to warm up\nthe display surface even with an ordinary hair dryer for 3 minutes at a temperature\nof 70 degrees Celsius. In the process of opening the iPhone 12 Pro,\nyou will have to pull quite hard on the suction cup ring, I think this is due to the reinforced\nglue used in this phone model. The iPhone 12 Pro opens like a book, that\nis, opening the display to the left. Now the display is thinner and lighter, and\nnow the iPhone12 Pro screen is interchangeable with the iPhone 12. Previously, there was no interchangeability\nbetween models, but now something has changed in Apple's policy. The iPhone 12 Pro's camera module is very\nsimilar to the previous 11-series model, but technically there are changes such as RAW\nphotos, dual optical image stabilization and LiDAR technology that improves photos in low\nlight. We will return to the LiDAR module a little\nlater. The SIM card reader is still a separate module\nand can be easily replaced. The module is also interchangeable with the\niPhone 12. The process of replacing the speaker is much\neasier - no adhesive tape, just remove and replace. The speaker housing is the same as on the\niPhone 12 and is also interchangeable between models. The Taptic Engine is now half the size of\nthe previous iPhone. Also interchangeable with the iPhone 12. Removing the speaker and Taptic Engine, we\nget access to the lower silicone adheseve tapes that hold the battery, in the upper\npart there are the same silicone tapes, but unfortunately, there is a cable close to the\nbattery, which prevents the safe removal of these silicone tapes. The Face-ID module is nothing new. The module did not receive any changes. Now it is possible to slide the motherboard\nand access the top of the battery. Let's removing silicone tapes. So, we can conclude that in order to replace\nthe battery in the iPhone 12 Pro, you need to take a lot of steps. More than 70% of the smartphone has already\nbeen disassembled. The battery in the iPhone 12 Pro has the same\nnumber A2479 as the iPhone 12 and is interchangeable with each other. On the back you can see the battery capacity\nof 2815mAh – also the same with the iPhone 12 battery. To remove the main board, remove the screws\non the case to release this cable. That's it, now we can remove the main board\nand take a closer look. Now you can see that this cable is connected\nto the back of the motherboard. If you peel off this protective black film,\nyou can see that this cable cannot be disconnected so easily, because it is soldered to the logic\nboard. On the Asian versions of the iPhone 12 and\n12 Pro, motherboards without such a cable, and in my case, the iPhone 12 Pro for the\nUS market This cable directly connects the motherboard\nto the 5G mmWave antenna module. In the iPhone model A2341 for the US market,\nthe 5G mmWave antenna module is built into the side of the smartphone back housing and\nthis is how it looks. On the outside of the case, this matte area\nunder the power button is the window for the 5G mmWave antenna. Another antenna module is located on the back\nof the motherboard. And now we got to the LIDAR scanner. This is the same sensor that Apple showed\nat the iPhone 12 presentation. The LiDAR sensor improves the quality of photo\n(especially in low light conditions). Also with this sensor, the iPhone makes measurements\nin space more accurately. It's great that this sensor is separate from\nthe camera module and can be easily replaced. The  light sensor located on a separate cable. This is a cable with a diode camera flash. It is very easy to remove this cable, so if\nthe diode is damaged, you can easily replace it. Let's see what's left on the iPhone back housing. In the lower part - cable with a lightning\nconnector, in the upper part - antennas. In the middle of the case there is a wireless\ncharging module and now it also has a magnetic ring. The magnets are located along the edge of\nthe wireless charging coil. There are 18 small neodymium magnets glued\nhere. So, the disassembly of the iPhone 12 Pro is\ncomplete. If you need more instructions for all iPhone\n12 models in the description you will find all the links. Ok guys, that's all, you were on HowFixit\nand see you next time.",

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Teardown - Where are the Magnets?!",
      "transcript": "today we're going to take apart the brand new iphone 12 pro we already know the outside is new and different with its stainless steel sides flush screen and ceramic shield glass but we know true beauty lies on the inside the iphone 12 pro has a series of magnets just below the back glass and i'm curious to see what those look like from the inside one thing you really want to avoid though is letting your wallet or credit card get too close to the back of the phone magnets can ruin credit cards unless of course you carry a shielded wallet huge thanks to ridge wallets for sponsoring this video i got my own ridge wallet about two years ago and it's been in my front pocket ever since i got the burnt titanium version since titanium is one of the coolest metals in existence fun fact did you know there's a hidden spider on the one dollar bill cool little trick to show your friends all you need is a dollar and some friends if you don't have either you can still optimistically get a new wallet and just hope for the best like we're all doing for 2021 mine's a bit worn after being in my pocket for two years but the burnt titanium still looks pretty good it can hold up to 12 cards plus cash the ridge wallet comes in 30 different styles like aluminum carbon fiber forged carbon and a limited edition topographical map of half dome and you can choose between the money strap or the clip version since these are metal of course you probably don't want to carry them in the same pocket as your iphone but it's good to know that if they do ever end up next to each other on a table or desk or something the magnets in your phone won't hurt the cards since the wallets are shielded i'll leave a link down in the description you can use the code jerryrig to get 10 off your order and free worldwide shipping there's a lifetime warranty and a full 45 day return policy if you don't like it i've definitely been happy with mine though now it's time to take apart the new iphone 12 pro let's get started the iphone 12 pro design has changed things up a bit this year but of course it still has the two pentalobe screws down at the bottom this time around the iphone 12 pro is quite a bit more water resistant as well still ip68 but tested at a depth of 6 meters in water instead of the normal 4 meters that the iphone 11 pro was tested at last year so there is quite a bit more adhesive which requires more heat and the screen being inlaid flush with the stainless steel housing also makes things a little more difficult long story short the quickest way to learn something new is by using someone else's mistakes and as i was lifting up the screen i didn't go quite deep enough to grab the frame and i accidentally stabbed the screen under the glass and while i was able to get the screen off into one piece that little stab in the wrong spot killed the screen entirely so it's a good idea to learn from my mistakes if you ever need to open one of these up the phone is still alive but now i'll need a new screen anyway besides the fact that i just broke a phone in front of millions of people there are two tri-point screws holding down a metal plate over the battery i'll remove those as well as the metal plate so we can get to the real goods inside i'll unsnap the battery ribbon just like a little lego along with the screen ribbon there's another plate up top with four more tri-point screws that i'll remove before unsnapping the screen from the phone entirely replacement iphone 11 pro screens are around 170 right now so i imagine the iphone 12 pro will be priced similarly when they start coming out if apple doesn't digitally lock them to the motherboard making third-party repairs impossible which they seem to be doing more of lately there is a smorgasbord of other connectors revealed now that the screen is gone connectors on top of connectors so it looks like i'll just be unsnap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snapping them just like little legos the last one is taped to the top of the motherboard so i'll peel it back and move it out of the way before we head over to the cameras there are four screws holding down the metal plate over the camera units the iphones are always super complex inside and this one requires at least four different screwdriver bits and a whole lot of organization since pretty much each screw is a different size and shape the top camera is the main one the 12 megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization then we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera with no ois and the bottom 12 megapixel two times optical zoom camera which does have that ois you might be asking hey jerry what about the lidar sensor and that's a great question we'll get to it in a second still inside of the phone we have the front face id and the 12 megapixel selfie camera the lidar module is still screwed in and facing the rear of the phone the brains of the operation the motherboard has six screws holding it in place the sim card tray has a white water damage indicator sticker over the top grille the sticker can be seen from outside of the phone if you just peek inside of your sim card tray slot apple's pretty smart their phones might be water resistant but they're not waterproof and apple can tell if it ever gets wet when that sticker turns pink there are two more ribbons at the bottom of the motherboard and then the whole thing can pull away from the phone it's another double stacked board again this year with no thermal paste or copper heat pipe it's just living its best life with no extra cooling the lidar sensor is held in place by two more screws lidar is actually pretty cool it's like a depth sensor on steroids able to bounce infrared light from one circle and measure the bounce back to calculate distances it makes for some really fast 3d scanning and measuring it's even found in some self-driving cars here in the iphone it'll probably mostly be used for really fast autofocusing for the camera but it's still cool to see futuristic technology in a mainstream smartphone now the iphone battery does have the magical pull tabs but i'm going to bust your bubble and just break it to you that i basically broke all of them and had to pull the battery out with my bare hands instead the battery is a bit smaller than last year's iphone 11 pro sitting at just 2 815 milliamp hours we also get our first look at the top side of the wireless charging coil spoiler alert the other side looks way cooler but first we'll pull out the loudspeaker it's a gigantic mess down here with 10 more different sized and shaped screws and standoffs but we finally do get to lift out the loudspeaker with its water resistant mesh inside of the opening as well as a new massive orange gasket to help seal up that hole the sim card tray is modular kind of fun the taptic engine is also a bit smaller this year but interesting fact apple plopped a lego style connector right in the middle of the ribbon whoever said apple doesn't innovate has obviously never seen this plus there's this thing down here that looks super important and i don't even know what it does if the iphone looks like a chaotic nightmare inside it's because it is the wireless charger is physically tied into the phone's side buttons so i'll unscrew this metal bracket on the side and pull the mute switch through the frame then finally after everything we get our first look under the wireless charging pad and glimpse this glorious array of circular magnets around the outside it's rather brilliant of apple to use magnets to perfectly position the two coils on top of each other instead of using one large circle magnet it's actually made up of 18 smaller more rectangular magnets apple has said that every single magnet used in the iphone 12 is recycled which is awesome getting rid of the charging brick headphones and making the box smaller is also supposed to help out the environment fun fact though creating a brand new smartphone consumes almost as much energy as using a smartphone for an entire decade so since apple has over 1 billion active iphones on the planet right now if they really wanted to help the environment they'd make their phones easier to repair i mean let's be honest making the box smaller as peanuts compared to how much energy we could save by just using our phones for an additional year or two not much changes between each new version of a phone anyway of course every step towards helping the environment is a good step but i would like to see apple facilitating repairs instead of just locking every component to the motherboard and having people buy new phones which seems to be their current trend the underside of the glass can be scratched away making for a small frosted glimpse into the wireless charger apple could make one of the coolest clear phones of all time with this coil but they didn't so i did every real detail from the inside of the phone can now be seen on the outside without voiding your warranty even the magnets we can see the magnets the charging coil and even the water damage indicator sticker here on the sim card tray and if we bring over the magical magnetic magsafe charger we can see how the two work together the charging coil plugged into the wall creates a small energy field that the receiving coil can receive science is pretty cool i'll leave a link for my tear down skin down in the video description along with the ridge wallet and i'll get this phone put back together and working again once i find a replacement screen let me know what you think of apple's new charging system would you ever buy a clear iphone let me know down in the comments coming out with me on instagram and twitter and thanks a ton for watching i'll see you around",

      "title": "iPhone 12 Pro Screen Replacement",
      "transcript": "hi welcome simon here and hope you're doing well in this video i'll walk you through step by step on how to replace a crack screen on your iphone 12 pro all right so this is the screen replacement here and if you're not sure where to buy the screen or the replacement tools sorry the replacement screen and the tools what i'll do is i'll link them in a description below where you can go ahead and click on it it will direct you to either amazon or ebay so that you can buy the right tools and the right parts and you can follow along the video for the screen replacement all right the first thing you need to do is to go ahead and get yourself the 0.8 pentalobe p2 screwdriver so this little style looking thing 0.8 is the size of the screw and you want to remove the two screws here at the very bottom of your phone all right so let's go ahead and remove that once you have removed the two screws let's go ahead and get a hay dryer if you do not uh if if you have one all you can go ahead and get yourself the uh heat gun so the goal of this is to heat up the phone because the phone is waterproof uh does you know prevent dust getting in or water getting into the phone so they do have adhesive all around the phone so the goal here is to use the heat gun or the hay dryer to warm up the adhesive so that you can easily pry this phone screen up i'm using my finger to touch the screen i'm trying to make sure that the heat gun is not overheating the phone i do not want to have any overheating or internal damage to this to the phone like the battery or the motherboard so you just want to hit warm enough to pry the thing open the screen open but not overheating the phone okay so get yourself a metal prying tool go ahead and stick it in between the phone just like that okay all right so i have a good contact with the phone i'm in between the phone and the screen so i'm just running the prying tool to cut that adhesive apart okay now if you get stuck at this point you can always come back and re-hit that phone again so i was just doing on the bottom part earlier not much on the top you can always come back to reheat it for the second time uh so all right once you have the entire screen adhesive cut off so you want to flip the phone to your left that is where the opening is all right so the iphone 12 pro it flips to the left the next part is to go ahead and get yourself the tri screwdriver or what we call the y screwdriver 0.6 remove the two screws and once you have done that go ahead and remove the bracket as well at this point here so this is the battery connector you can go ahead and disconnect the battery by simply lifting it straight up they're kind of like lego they snap onto it to remove you simply leave it straight up the next step is to go ahead and push it to the side all right so now here we can go ahead and disconnect this cable that's for your lcd screen and underneath that is your digitizer so both of these connectors are for the the screen top and bottom okay so once you have disconnected two screen now go ahead and start working on the top here using the y screwdriver or the tri screwdriver again this is the 0.6 the size of the the screwdriver there are four screws remove all the four screws now the bracket will just come right off okay so once the bracket is off this is your ear speaker the proximity sensor so we need to disconnect that as well because we are transferring that over to the new screen so at this point here the entire screen just come right off okay so what we're going to do is we are going to have the new screen radio on the right side the broken screen original will be on the middle part we are transferring everything over from here to the new screen continue the process by removing the screw here that two screws i did was the tri screwdriver the y and the other two the top and bottom here they have the phillips screwdriver once you have removed that part now you want to be very careful when you disconnect that cable here i want you to pay close attention to that so the sensor uh double-sided adhesive onto the phone so when you remove it you got to be very careful and gently okay and again my screen is kind of damaged here in the front so i might have some challenge to remove it but i'll do my best here and show it to you because of the impact on the screen i might have some difficulty to remove that but i'll i'll see what i can do okay looks like i was able to remove them easily there you go now we just have to transfer that proximity sensor back to that new screen you can just follow along by pushing down the sensor back to the bracket itself okay once you have them installed correctly just go ahead and holding down to that proximity sensor the ear speaker here on the phone holding it down now go get your phillips screwdriver and put that screw back together there are four screws in total two is the wide screwdriver on the top left and the bottom left the phillip is the top right and the bottom right take your time when you put the screw back together sometimes they're difficult to align because they're very tiny but once you get used to it you should be very easily to put it back now again the connector are just like lego you have them allowing the right position and you can just press it down and it will just go back in very easily you shouldn't be using a lot of force that it doesn't take like a heavy you know force or pressure to push it down uh if you're having that difficulty you just have to come back and realign that connector carefully do not force it down because if you press it too hard you may broke that connector or you know make a bend to the connector on the phone then that would be a very difficult repair uh to replace that connector okay once you have that installed now go ahead and put the battery back together so i have the two cables installed and the battery installed as well now you can just go ahead and realign that bracket here back into the right position so you need to slide it in first and then close it down so there are four wide screwdriver also wide screws or the tri screws so i'll be using the same tri screw driver here that's 0.6 putting all four screws back together okay once you have done that process come back here make sure all that cable are still in the right position get your bracket back on top of that cables align them in a position where you can put that screw back together okay i believe my phone battery has ran out but i'll give it a try to power up hopefully there is some juice to power up the phone but we will find out later on so at this point here you see the top here has two little latch on the very top of the phone so you want to slide that top thing in on the top first so slide it in while holding that you can start pressing the side down to crunch it down on every single corner all right so the phone should sit flat all around the corner it should be sitting flat now putting the two screws back together it's very simple and let's go ahead and start powering up the phone hopefully there's enough power to turn on the phone all right it looks like i do have some power and the phone is turning on okay so i hope i hope the video is helpful for you let me cover up the uh the display there might be some kind of uh image or the background of of the of the thing so let's just cover it up and there you go so i hope the phone is helpful i mean um sorry i hope that the video is helpful for you and if you find a video is helpful

Once you have the entire screen adhesive cut off so you want to flip the phone to your left that is where the opening is all right so the iphone 12 pro it flips to the left the next part is to get yourself the tri screwdriver or what we call the y screwdriver 0.6 remove the two screws and once you have done that go ahead and remove the bracket as well at this point here.

      "title": "Google Pixel 5 5G Disassembly Teardown Repair Video Review. Screen Gap?",
      "transcript": "you're watching the google pixel 5 disassembly so we got the phone brand new let's see if this one has that gap issue people are experiencing for the most part it seems okay before we take the phone apart we need to remove the sim tray now we're going to use a hairdryer or a heat gun to heat the front of the phone where the screen is so we can loosen up the adhesive around the frame of the screen and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off from the mid frame all right so trying to pry the screen assembly from the mid frame wasn't all that easy aside from the adhesive there are some catches around the screen which you need to work around and try to pop them off once you're finally able to pry the screen off from the frame you're going to lift it up from the right to the left and then you have a cable over here which is attached to the main board you're gonna have to disconnect first we need to pop off this bracket and then we'll go ahead and disconnect the cable so here's a better look at your screen assembly you have one of those vibrating motors as an earpiece which basically sends vibrations on top of the glass and provides sound on the sides of the screen assembly you can see these catches you can see on the other side as well so i'm pretty surprised that these start lifting up for some people off the frame because it has a lot of adhesive as well as the catches that go around so the only thing i can think of is when it heats up a little bit or the phone is in use the adhesive becomes loose and pries off just a little bit but i really don't think it's going to fall off or completely come off because it's pretty difficult taking that apart myself so maybe the type of adhesive they use doesn't work well with the screen plastic and the frame of the phone or when they're assembling the phone they didn't press down firmly so the adhesive would adhere to the frame so even if the screen is lifted up a little bit the seal isn't compromised so you don't really have to worry about water and dust getting in because the adhesive around the flexes a little bit and it's sticky and it takes some time trying to pry it off back to the phone itself we have a large strip of graphite film over here sitting on top of the battery as well as the cameras over here and little portion over here on top of this metal plate we'll go ahead and peel off this graphite film there are nine t3 screws or torx screws which need to be removed once those nine screws are removed you have two more over here by the charger port covered by this tape which you need to peel off once all 11 screws are removed we can go ahead and lift up this cover over here on the charger port and then we're going to remove this metal plate that's covering the motherboard on the back of this metal plate we have the vibrator motor over here we also have a thermal pad over here which is on top of the processor let's go ahead and disconnect the battery cable and then we'll go ahead and disconnect the rest of the cables once that's disconnected are the two cables over here for the cameras lift up and remove the cameras here's a better look at those two cameras i have one more cable over here underneath this one go and disconnect that now at this point we're going to apply some heat to the battery for the back side of the phone so we can loosen up the adhesive underneath and then we're going to pry the battery off so here's a better look at your battery and here's the other side once the battery is removed you can see there's more graphite film underneath to help transfer heat you have a fingerprint reader located over here and the same flex cable that goes for that goes for your volume key and your power button over here and in order to remove those there's a bracket over here you just slide this bracket off or remove it to gain access to the buttons now in order to remove the main board there are two t3 screws which need to be removed one of them located over here on the top left corner and there's one on bottom right corner once those screws are removed we can lift up and remove the main board a better look at your main board your proximity sensor is located over here on top your sim reader is located over here here's your charger port there's a red gasket around it your primary microphone is located over here is this gold square piece and here's the back side of the main board your front facing camera is located on top corner the connector you just have to just pop it off and remove it once the main board is removed you can see there's more graphite film underneath your loudspeaker is located over here on the bottom right hand corner in order to pry that off just to lift up and push away from the frame here's a better look at that you have two 5g millimeter wave antennas you have one on this corner over here and the flex cable for that is this and you have one over here on top and the flex cable is this long one right here you also have two more microphones which aren't the primary microphone located on top you have one over here on top of the cameras and you have one located over here on top of the frame over here and the flex cable over here with the four gold contacts is for your wireless charging pad which is underneath the graphite film you can see the shape of it all right now i'm gonna go ahead and put the phone back together once all your screws are back in place apply new adhesive and reapply the screen go ahead and power on the phone and you're done i hope you guys

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, Welcome back to geardo, Today we will show you how to replace the\nbattery on the google pixel 5 mobile phone. To start, we need the right tools to proceed\nwith the repair, which You can find in the description. The first step is to remove the LCD screen\nfrom the front. To remove the screen, it needs to heat gently\naround the screen edges until the pasted adhesive becomes soft. For this, we are using a heating pad. Place the front screen side on the heating\npad. Select the mobile phone heating option and\nleave it till it completes. Alternatively, you can use a heat gun or hairdryer. Once you feel the Heating is enough, use a\nsuction cup to lift the screen a little and insert a plastic card pry tool or something\nsimilar to cut the adhesive around the LCD screen. Be gentle in this process; the flex connector\ncable is on the left-hand side of the screen. Always use the edge of the plastic card pry\ntool to avoid internal damages. Next, Lift the screen gradually from the right-hand\nside to the left-hand side and keep it like an open book. Next, take out the connector bracket using a tweezer. Next, disconnect the lcd connector plug from\nthe board. Now you can free the screen from the body. And Also, Always make sure to clean the frame\nedges. Next, release the graphite tape. Next, Disconnect the ten screws holding the\nlcd bracket. Two screws with a shield are hidden on top\nof the charging port board. Peel the tape and undo both screws and pull\nout  the bracket. Next, gently pull out the board bracket from\nthe body. Next, disconnect the battery plug. Next, extract both adhesives by pulling the\ntab. Please note that some phones may have extra\npulling tabs, and others may not. It depends on previous repairs and techniques. Next, gently using a pry tool, pull out the\nnot working battery from the body. Note that graphite tape comes along with the\nbattery. Some replacement parts come with it, and some\ndo not. But, You can always remove the tape from the\nold one and place it in the new battery. Next, place the new battery with adhesive. Next, connect the battery plug. Next, secure the board bracket by adding ten\nscrews. Make sure to add the small shield when adding\ntwo screws on top of the charging port board. Next, connect the screen for testing. Once the testing has passed, take out the\nscreen. Next, Before securing the LCD Screen, ensure\nit has enough glue; for this, can use B7000 glue or a new double-sided LCD adhesive. Here we are using b7000 glue. Next, secure the lcd  connector and then the connector bracket. Gently slide in the screen from the left and\nthen to the right. Slightly apply pressure on screen edges. Finally, we are adding bonding clips to fasten\nthe lcd screen. Leave it for some time and remove it; if not,\nuse some rubber bands to tighten the screen to the body.

      "transcript": "you're watching the Google pixel 5A disassembly if you want to see more videos like this make sure you like subscribe and click on notification Bell so you'll be notified the next time I upload a video and if you need any tools there are links in the description to start off this entry needs to be removed now heat needs to be applied to the front of the phone where the screen is to loosen up the adhesive underneath and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off now the screen can be lifted up towards the left side at which point there's a metal bracket over here covering the connector for the screen as well as a T4 screw over here or a Torx screw which is holding that metal bracket down that needs to be removed once that bracket or cover is removed we can disconnect the screen cable so taking a look at the screen there's a plastic frame bordering it which has multiple clips around it to ensure a secure seal there's also of course the adhesive water resistant seal around it and if you're to get a replacement screen which didn't come with this plastic border around it this plastic border is just held on with some adhesive to the screen so all you have to do is apply heat and pry it off and reapply it with new adhesive to your replacement screen there's a large graphing film over here which needs to be peeled off and the graphene film basically helps transfer heat there's another plastic cover over here which needs to be removed foreign once the plastic cover is removed and this protective tape is peeled back there are two hidden T4 screws there are 10 T4 screws which need to be removed when you're removing the screws keep a track of which screw goes where since some of the screws are in different lengths now that the screws are removed we can remove the metal bracket or cover over the charger port now the metal cover over the motherboard can be removed there's also a small plastic bracket which goes over here in the corner on this metal cover there's a flex table over here with a notification LED on top on the other side we can see the connector for that Flex cable over here these two gold contacts which make contact with the two points on the motherboard giving its signal there is also a vibrator motor over here on the bottom corner at this point we have access to disconnecting the flex cable for the battery there are two adhesive pull tabs provided to pry the battery off one is located over here on top and one over here on the bottom the bottom one doesn't happen to be a pull tab just some protective tape and I guess in general the pull tab is pretty useless since it tears when you try to pull it so instead we're gonna have to use some isopropyl alcohol and get some around the edges of the battery and let us sit there for about a minute so it needs to lay out the adhesive underneath making it easier to pry off okay here's a better look at the battery the 12.2 megapixel dual pixel and 16 megapixel Ultra wide lens can be disconnected by just popping off the connectors here's a better look at those cameras we can proceed to disconnect the rest of the cables the headphone jack cable can be disconnected and removed there is also a liquid damage indicator which is why it's thicker on the headphone jack there are three more T4 screws which need to be removed and then finally the motherboard can be lifted up and removed foreign there is another plastic bracket over here which goes on the corner by the speaker assembly so when you're reassembling it don't forget to put that piece in so taking a look at the motherboard we have the SIM card reader located right over here there's copper tape over here on top of the shield the proximity sensor is located over here on top and the primary microphones located over here on the bottom the charger port is soldered onto the board so making repairs on the charger port would be difficult there's also a red rubber gasket around the charger port there's also another liquid damage indicator located right next to the primary microphone which is that white sticker there's a white coaxial cable connecting the speaker assembly to the bottom of the motherboard which we're going to disconnect right now and that can be disconnected by just popping It Off once the shields on this side are removed there are some rubberized thermal pads or thermal paste on top of the processor RAM and the chip over here here's a better look at it with the thermal pads removed on the back side of the motherboard we can see more copper tape on top of the shield over here there's also a coaxial cable running over it and the front-facing camera connectors over here and there's a protective tape over here covering it that can be disconnected by just peeling off the tape and popping off the connector once the bottom Shield is removed and the copper tip is peeled back we can see some more thermal pads over here on top of these chips the flex cable for the volume keys and power button is over here and it's rather along the edges over here there's a metal bracket over here holding them in place which can be slid up and removed the fingerprint reader is located right over here and the flex cable is right underneath this Flex cable and it comes over here the flex cable for the camera flash is located right over here and it's routed underneath this metal cover which is held out with two T4 screws once that metal cover is removed you can lift up and remove that Flex cable the Erp speaker is located here on top at an angle and it's held down with adhesive so if you wanted to replace that you just have to gently pry it off also once I remove the battery I noticed there are two more pull tabs over here underneath on the bottom portion of the battery which are somewhat hidden but in reality these pull tabs are terrible because they're easily tear when you try to pull it off so applying isopropyl alcohol made it much easier to pry the battery off there's more grafting film over here covering that NFC antenna and there's a water resistant mesh filter over here for the microphone opening here's a better look at the speaker assembly there's a water resistant mesh filter over here covering the opening and underneath this white sticker over here there are the small white foam balls those help the speaker sound louder once the graphite film is peeled back we can see the cutout or opening in the housing where the NFC antenna is now I don't know why they didn't include wireless charging on this phone since they already did a cutout for the NFC antenna they could have just made it larger and added a wireless charging coil as far as repairability goes I give this phone a 5 out of 10. the screen replacement will be easy but aside from that it'll be more difficult to replace other parts now I'm going to go ahead and put the phone back together once everything's back in place apply new adhesive and replay your screen power it on and you're done thanks again for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video foreign",

      "summary": "Google pixel 5A disassembly. Heat needs to be applied to the front of the phone where the screen is to loosen up the adhesive underneath and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off. Once that bracket or cover is removed we can disconnect the screen cable. to get a replacement screen which didn't come with a plastic border around it this plastic border is just held on with some adhesive to the screen so all you have to do is apply heat and pry it off and reapply it with new adhesive to your replacement screen. LED on top on the other side we can see the connector for that Flex cable over here these two gold contacts which make contact with the two points on the motherboard giving its signal. There is also a vibrator motor over here on the bottom corner at this point we have access to disconnecting the flex cable for the battery. those cameras we can proceed to disconnect the rest of the cables the headphone jack cable can be disconnected and removed there is also a liquid damage indicator which is why it's thicker on the headphonejack there are three more T4 screws which need to be removed and then finally the motherboard can be lifted up and removed foreign. there's a white coaxial cable connecting the speaker assembly to the bottom of the motherboard which we're going to disconnect right now and that can be disconnected by just popping It Off. There are some rubberized thermal pads or thermal paste on top of the processor RAM and the chip over here. can be slid up and removed the fingerprint reader is located right over here and the flex cable is right underneath this Flex cable and it comes over here. There's a water resistant mesh filter over here for the microphone opening. speaker assembly there's a water resistant mesh filter over here covering the opening and underneath this white sticker over here there are the small white foam balls those help the speaker sound louder. I don't know why they didn't include wireless charging on this phone since they already did a cutout for the NFC antenna they could have just made it larger and added a wireless charging coil. the screen replacement will be easy but aside from that it'll be more difficult to replace other parts.",

      "transcript": "hello everyone this is Matt from Real World review and today we're going to replace a screen on the Google pixel 5. just so you know the display that I'm buying it comes with a frame though I don't really recommend using the frame I recommend retaining your own frame but that is something to think about when you are buying a new screen either way the tools that you're going to need are going to be a razor blade a plastic pick a playing card heat glue and some clamps that's it so the first thing you're going to do is obviously turn off the phone but then you're going to heat up the screen and you're going to use a razor blade to kind of lift up the screen just a little bit and then you're going to use the playing card or a pick to cut through the adhesive obviously be careful around broken glass but pretty much what you want to do is carefully go around just the trim of it you don't want to go under the screen especially if you're trying to retain the screen and not Break It ultimately the only thing you really have to worry about is the connections on the bottom and the display cable on the left side you shouldn't have to worry too much about the earpiece if you're not going in too far once you get rid of all of that the screen will lift up to the left side and then you can carefully lift up this little metal piece to expose where the display plugs in and then you want to carefully lift it up make sure not to damage any of the components on the top area and we can separate the screen next you can start removing the adhesive but technically it doesn't matter because the screen that I did buy does have a frame so I don't really have to worry about that I'll just end up removing that first but if you didn't buy the screen with the frame you want to be careful to make sure to preserve the frame that is on the phone so that you can use it for the new screen either way the places that we're going to be applying glue is pretty much going to be the same area so whether you have the frame or not doesn't really matter this video will still help you out but what we're going to do is we're going to carefully plug in the display power on the phone and make sure that it not only works but it also touches and it looks like it does so what we're going to do is we're going to remove the display we are going to remove the frame again you can skip over this if you're going to continue using this Frame and we're going to carefully lift it up and the adhesive should kind of come off you might have to clean up some of that adhesive if it doesn't come off there are some clips that go into this so you kind of have to break through those or they should just lift out like they did for me either way carefully remove that remove all the adhesive that's attached to it and then we should be ready to move the other things so sometimes this works other times this doesn't so I personally just buy another earpiece but you do have to move over this earpiece if you don't have one so we can remove it like this and just make sure that you expose the adhesive so that it kind of sticks onto the screen or more onto the frame but you want to make sure that it stays in either way so we're going to carefully set this back into the phone like this and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to carefully set the screen down just so that I can get the speaker to stick onto the screen so then when I put the screen down it lines up properly and now it looks fine I do recommend using some adhesive to kind of stick it down into the phone if this is a little bit difficult for you but for me it worked out so what we're going to do is we're going to add the glue to the edges of the phone pretty much on the black area where the frame is or I guess green if you have the sage one I think but yeah just make sure to go all the way around the screen there's nothing you can really damage there then once you add all that glue we can plug in the display like this we can put this little metal cover back on making sure that it Clips in then last thing we want to do is power on the phone make sure that the screen works and it looks like it does power it off and then we can set the screen down like this lastly we want to apply clamps I recommend three to five I did three in this case on each side and the last step pretty much is to let this sit for about two hours and once it's done setting you want to take off those clamps clean up any adhesive and then enjoy using the phone hopefully this video helped you out social media is listed above and as always thanks for watching",

Once you get rid of all of that the screen will lift up to the right side. If you didn't buy the screen with the frame you want to be careful to make sure to preserve the frame. matter this video will still help you out. We're going to carefully plug in the display power on the phone and make sure that it not only works but it also touches and it looks like it does. Expose the adhesive so that it kind of sticks onto the screen or more onto the frame but you want to make sure that it stays in either way. Once you add all that glue we can plug in the display like this we can put this little metal cover back on. power on the phone make sure that the screen works and it looks like it does power it off and then we can set the screen down like this lastly we want to apply clamps I recommend three to five I did three in this case on each side.

      "transcript": "so you have a google pixel 5 8 and you have an issue where you have a black screen even though you have a black screen you know that the phone is still on maybe you can get here phone calls coming in you can hear it ringing maybe you can feel it vibrating so the phone is on it's just that you have a black screen the screen won't come on another way to tell if your phone is on is if you go ahead and you give your phone power and this phone is fixed by the way okay but when you plug it in i just felt it vibrate you should be able to hear it vibrate okay so we'll give you guys several solutions get you up and running right now let's pretend i have a black screen here all right first thing you want to do is try to force restart it very simple how do you force restart you simply press and hold this power button and do not let go until you see the google logo appear okay so we'll do it together so let's pretend that the screen is totally black here we're going to press and hold this power button ready one two three press and hold do not let go keep on holding don't worry about what's happening to screen let's pretend the screen is totally black i have no idea what's going on i'm just holding onto this power button waiting for a google logo to appear then i can let go still holding still holding here oh google logo go ahead and let go and now hopefully you are up and running if not we're gonna go to the next possible step okay so your screen is still black next thing i want you to do is this okay i want you to spam the power button and the volume up and down rockers okay spamming by this power button just press it in and out because a lot of times if the power button is stuck or jammed or like loose it can cause the black screen of death as well just keep spamming it same thing the volume up and down rockers too do the same thing volume down volume up okay now what we're going to do is plug in the cable we're going to let it charge pop it in here i just felt it vibrate okay again let's pretend my screen is black i have it charging now from here same thing we're going to force restart it simply by pressing and holding this power button so we'll do it together while it's charging ready one two three press and hold that power button do not let go until we see that google logo appeared don't worry about what's happening to my screen let's pretend my screen is totally black i have no idea what's going on i'm just holding onto this power button hoping for a google logo to appear still holding still holding come on google logo there it is go ahead and let go and now hopefully you are up and running if not we're going to go to the next possible solution okay so your phone is still black the screen is still not coming on so next thing we're going to do here is what i call the tap method we're going to do is hold the phone like this and we're gonna use grab two fingers and we're gonna tap all over the screen and all over the back okay so we'll go ahead and start on the screen here two fingers and i want you to do is kind of press kind of tap kind of hard everywhere okay now simply by you doing this sometimes what happens is you you basically have something slightly dislodged inside the phone and a simple tap can pop it back in place now sometimes if you're tapping like this all of a sudden your screen might turn on sometimes it'll start like rebooting sometimes you get half a screen sometimes you'll get lines okay just keep on tapping all right and screen is still black no problem turn it back over and then we're gonna do the same thing on the back side okay tap kind of hard two fingers all over even around the lens okay you want to get all in the lens try to get all the corners too kind of keep on tapping everywhere look at your phone okay it's still black no problem now from here again remember press and hold this power button and do not let go until you see the google logo appear okay still

come on where's it at oh there it is go ahead and let go and now hopefully you are up and running if not we're going to go the next possible solution okay so your screen is still black next i have for you is what i call the massage method because what we're going to do is we're going to massage the phone now what we're going to do is hold the phone with two hands like this and this is the same premise as tapping okay maybe you have something slightly dislodged what i want to do is what you guys want to do is hold the phone like this and use your thumbs and you want to press on the screen okay you can use like a some kind of cloth or paper towel if you don't want to smudge up your screen or whatnot but basically what we're going to do is hold the phone like this and we're going to press in keep massaging it kind of hard okay sometimes you hear a little click and the screen will pop on okay or sometimes you're just constantly doing this the screen will pop on again you may get half a screen you might get white lines or whatnot just keep pressing pressing press press give the nice massage all over even the very bottom okay screen is still black no problem turn it back over to the back now okay and the same thing on the back we're gonna press and press and sometimes you hear little click you know turn it over like oh wow it's on anyway keep pressing pressing okay even around the camera lens you wanna press around the camera lens even on the top here on the corner press press press all right all the way turn it over okay black screen no problem again from here same thing force restart it press and hold that power button and do not let go until the google logo appears then let go okay now if you guys are still down the next um possible solution i have for you is what i call the smack method y because we're going to smack the phone i want you to hold your palm out like this and i want you to go ahead and grab the phone and what we're going to do is start on the screen here what we're going to do is going to smack it okay look at the phone okay it's still black okay also on the bottom the bottom of the screen okay get a couple whacks look at the screen

problem force restarted again press and hold that power button and do not let go until you see a google logo appear then let go okay because you're still down we're gonna go the next possible solution okay so the next solution i have for you is what i call the freezer method why because what i want you to do is put your your just uh put your phone into the freezer okay so i want you to grab the phone as is just like this i want you to go to your freezer i want you to put it in just like this and leave it there for 15 minutes okay close the freezer door leave it there for 15 minutes after 15

the power button and just wait patiently until you see that google logo appear right keep on holding come on where's that google logo there it is go ahead and let go and now hopefully you are up and running now the thing is if you guys went through all these steps and you're still down then what i want you to do is this okay first thing is if you guys have a case on it pry the case off also if you have a screen protector take the screen protector off okay and now i want you to start from the very beginning of the video and try every single step two times doesn't work three times four times try it up to seven times okay sometimes seven the seventh time is a charm believe it or not now if you tried every step at least seven times i'm going to say at least 75 percent of you should now have a working screen and you're not going to need any kind of screen replacement or anything so if this worked for you give me a thumbs up comment which method worked for you and if it didn't work for you give me a thumbs down so everybody can see that we should see at least a 75 percent thumbs up ratio okay good luck guys",

      "title": "Google Pixel 4a Teardown! - its a tricky little guy...",
      "transcript": "today we're going to take apart google's cheapest phone the plastic pixel 4a last year the pixel 3a won my most repairable smartphone of 2019 so the 4a has pretty big shoes to fill let's get started the pixel 4a has a few different layers the screen the mid frame and then the back panel this phone is not built like a conventional phone one of the things that makes the 4a so repairable is that the screen comes off first and there's nothing attached to it screen repairs are some of the most common repairs so it's nice when it can be done in just a few minutes the problem though is that the screen itself underneath the glass is just about as thin as a potato chip and just as fragile so the chance of the screen surviving at tear down is slimmer than usual and judging by the crack in the display underneath the glass i think this one's a goner potato chips aren't very strong we'll have to see if i broke it for good or not later the 4a seems to be constructed in pretty much the exact same way as the pixel 3a from last year with just one ribbon cable and it's two t3 screws holding the ribbon in place last year's pixel 3a screen replacement costs about 80 this year so not too bad the rest of the screws in this phone are a slightly larger t4 size i'll include the tool kit that i'm using down in the video description there are eight screws holding down that mid-frame and then we can pop the mid-frame out and away from the back plastics well almost apparently someone left the sim card tray installed but i don't want to point any fingers it's time to call for unity the motherboard is attached to the underside of the mid-frame two thin ribbon cables connect the board to the back plastic housing and before we can unclip those ribbons i need to remove seven more t4 screws holding down the metal shield over the motherboard once that's gone then we can unclip the fingerprint scanner and the rear flash just like little legos which then releases the plastic housing and its delicious candy corn from the phone something that's probably equally delicious is this mountain of pink thermal foam near the camera lens probably the thickest we've ever seen it's a little squishy forbidden snack acting like a piece of cake or something moving on to the battery this is where i got tricked without any visible pull tabs i thought for sure google was going to get it talking to about repairability but after prying up the battery i do see pull tabs but for some reason the tabs are too deep underneath the battery to ever be reachable i thought that maybe google might have got the wrong size pull tabs on clearance from the battery pull tab store you know to keep the price low but it turns out battery pull tabs are meant to be pulled from the opposite side of the mid-frame so the 4a does have magical pull tabs and they are indeed functional just not in the place that they normally are no complaints here though with an easy screen and battery replacement the pixel 4a is still really repairable the pixel 4a battery is 3140 milliamp hours which is quite a bit larger than the iphone 12 pro awkward i'll pull the loudspeaker out this guy does have a white sticker on top that holds in a bunch of the sound dampening balls these little circles of foam help us sound bigger than it actually is and if we take a look at the speaker opening on the frame we can see that there is indeed some waterproofing mesh but don't get too excited about water resistance just yet since there still is none anywhere else the motherboard itself has two screws holding it in place and a series of black clips around the outside that keep it snug into the mid frame once it's out we can get our first look at the singular camera which does have ois not too shabby and over here on the motherboard we find the white water damage indicator sticker that's underneath the headphone jack i assume google stuck it here in this specific position because that's where they assume water is most likely to enter the phone the sticker will turn pink if it ever gets wet so it's still important to keep your phone away from water the front-facing camera is 8 megapixels and does not have the optical image stabilization the side buttons do have their own ribbon with gold contact pads that communicate with the motherboard when it's resting against the frame and the headphone jack is not watertight as we can see from how easy it is to remove from the phone down here at the bottom we have the smallest of charging port ribbons along with the circular vibrator and as far as cooling goes there is a small layer of copper foil facilitating the heat transfer between the motherboard and the metal mid frame this mid frame is probably what kept the phone from snapping during my durability test the outsides might be plastic but the insides most definitely are not i'll get the motherboard back in along with the loudspeaker which is still leaking balls all over the place once that sticker comes off it doesn't go back on very well personally i'm glad that google made the 4a it's cheap repairable and has the good camera that google is known for and not everyone wants to buy a smartphone that costs as much as a used car once i get the mid frame screwed back into the plastic back we can position the screen over its lego style connector get it clipped in and well i guess 2020 isn't over yet i have made a tear down skin for the pixel 4a so you can get all the perks of getting inside of your phone without actually getting inside of your phone the skin also works with a dbrand grip so you can have style and protection with the clicky buttons as a cherry on top i'll leave a link in the video description we have tear down skins for over 60 devices now so there's a good chance we're covering yours let me know what phones you want to see tested before the end of the year down in the comments and come hang out with me on instagram and twitter thanks no for watching i'll see you around",

      "summary": "today we're going to take apart google's cheapest phone the plastic pixel 4a last year the pixel 3a won my most repairable smartphone of 2019 so the 4a has pretty big shoes to fill. last year with just one ribbon cable and it's two t3 screws holding the ribbon in place last year's pixel 3a screen replacement costs about 80 this year so not too bad. probably equally delicious is this mountain of pink thermal foam near the camera lens probably the thickest we've ever seen it's a little squishy forbidden snack acting like a piece of cake or something moving on to the battery this is where i got tricked without any visible pull tabs i thought for sure google was going to get it talking to about repairability but after prying up the battery i do see pull tabs but for some reason the tabs are too deep underneath the battery to ever be reachable. quite a bit larger than the iphone 12 pro awkward i'll pull the loudspeaker out this guy does have a white sticker on top that holds in a bunch of the sound dampening balls these little circles of foam help us sound bigger than it actually is.

      "title": "Paid $98 For A Broken Google Pixel 4a 5G - Lets Repair It!",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge jefferies video in this video i'll be repairing this google pixel 4a 5g it's got a dead display that has been internally cracked from a small drop the outer glass is in perfect condition but that small damage to the internal layers of the screen has rendered this phone unusable having repaired the regular google pixel 4 i can say it wasn't the easiest to repair as the screen was the last thing to come out it was also glued in stronger than it needed to be so strong in fact the display's layers separated when i attempted to remove it the pixel 4a is google's mid-range option the question is how does it hold up in terms of repairability with previous pixel models i found the a series to be a lot easier to work on let's see if that trend followed through with the pixel 4 a5g i purchased this one online for under a hundred dollars looking at the condition of the parcel it arrived in it barely made it included with the phone was its original box paperwork a sim ejector and usb-c adapter but no charger probably because they kept it as their new phone likely didn't come with one but considering the price i'm not worried as the cheapest used one on ebay is listed at 550 dollars 450 more than what i paid plugging it in it makes a charging sound but no image displays so it's time we opened it up to do that i'll heat up the display using my heat plate which will soften the adhesive holding on the display like the pixel 3a this phone also opens from the front using my suction cup and one plastic pick i was able to slice through the adhesive effortlessly seriously it's less strong than the pixel 4 and other phones like the newer iphone models once the display is loose it can be lifted up and away from the phone revealing the one cable connecting it to the phone's motherboard it's covered by a piece of tape and a plastic cover both need to be removed before the display's flex cable can be detached i don't know many phones with a screen removal process that's that easy google really did a good job at this point you could reattach the new screen and be on your way but as my phone is still powered on and no way of shutting it down i'm wanting to disconnect the battery first before attaching the new screen as simply misaligning the cable when plugging it in could short out and damage the phone further alternatively you could wait until the phone went flat but as time was a constraint i didn't take this approach google has chosen to use torque screws to attach the back panel to the mid frame after all nine screws and the sim tray are removed the back can be unclipped from the phone however it's still attached by two short cables to unplug those i'll first need to detach the device's heatsink which also doubles as a large flex cable retaining bracket after the battery is unplugged i can finally detach the back panel just like that we've removed the back and gained access to the battery cameras headphone jack motherboard and charging port all of which are modular components in terms of a modern smartphone from a massive tech company this one's internals is quite accessible but it doesn't just stop there google has provided some pull tab strips to help remove the battery these are located on the display side and are hidden under some copper tape they are similar to the ones apple uses for their batteries while they do aid removal they're oddly not present on the pixel 6 smartphones that it took apart recently as this phone is only six months old according to the previous owner i see no need to replace the battery this means i can start reassembling the phone attaching the flex cables for the led flash and fingerprint reader after which the battery can be plugged in and secured down with the main bracket google's pixel smartphones are very different internally to most other android phones in fact it kind of reminds me of the internals of an iphone the screws inside also vary in length so you'll need to keep track of them something unusual to see with android phones but common to the pixel i'll clip the back panel back into place before securing it with its 9 torx screws before attaching the new display i'll need to clean off the residual adhesive left on the midframe this is the most important step as applying over the old adhesive will cause the screen not to sit flush and be more likely to lift up and cause gaps around its perimeter the new oled display cost me 157 australian dollars observing it and the damaged one we removed the screens used on this phone appear to be only hard oled displays this means the internal layers are not flexible like the ones found in soft oled screens which would explain why it broke so easily hard oled displays are cheaper to make and given this is a mid-range phone it's not strange to see a hard oled display used nevertheless i'll get its flex cable attached the plug is quite recessed which makes connecting the cable a little challenging but with it installed the plastic retaining bracket and tape can be reapplied before gluing on the display it's a good practice to test out the phone and the new display because you wouldn't want to attach the screen only to have to try and get it up if something isn't working right or you forgot to connect a flex cable with everything tested and verified working correctly i'll remove the plastic protective film from the back of the display and apply some adhesive as the bezels are very tiny i'll be using liquid adhesive specifically e8000 you can buy replacement adhesive strips but they're hard to come by liquid adhesive isn't ideal for a water resistant phone but this one isn't so that's not an issue what's most important is to ensure correct application of the adhesive to make sure the screen is attached properly a good solid bead of adhesive needs to be applied after aligning the display with the frame everything needs to be held in place using rubber bands this adhesive takes hours to dry and removing the rubber bands too early can cause the screen not to be glued down properly and start lifting up from the frame that's the mistake most quick repair shops make they use this type of glue and don't allow it to dry so the customer ends up with a screen that's not attached after having left mine overnight i can remove the rubber bands and clean off any glue that seeped out the edges after which the phone has been fully reassembled the only thing left to do is remove the plastic protective film and we're done so this is it a repaired google pixel 4a 5g total costs including the phone and new display total 255 australian dollars that's 295 dollars cheaper than the cheapest pixel 4a on ebay at the present time so this has turned out to be a very good deal in terms of repairability this is about as good as it gets from google if you can get away with the specs of the pixel a line i don't really see the need for the regular pixel smartphones they're harder to fix like a headphone jack and cost more i believe the pixel a line is the best phones google sells and on that note this has been a huge jeffries video if

      "transcript": "you have a google pixel 4a and you have an issue where you have a black screen or basically it won't turn on however you know the phone is on maybe you see some led lights maybe you hear it ring maybe you feel it vibrate but the screen just doesn't come on i'm going to give you guys several solutions to get you up and running right now so first thing is just take note that this phone is actually working but let's just pretend i have a black screen here okay so i don't see nothing on the screen i don't know what's going on now the first step what we're going to do is we're going to force it to restart you're not going to lose any data by doing that there's a power button right here you want to press and hold this button do not let go until you see the google logo appear then you can let go okay so let's just pretend my screen is totally black power button here ready one two three press and hold pretend my screen is black i have no idea what's going on i just have a black screen here and i'm still holding on to this power button waiting for that google logo to appear what's going to happen it's going to reboot basically you're forcing it to restart so it just turned off now i'm waiting okay i'm still holding there it is google logo let go and now hopefully you guys are up and running i i want to mention really quickly if you guys go through all the steps and none of the steps worked it may be an issue because you may want to take your case off and if you have a screen protector you may want to take that off as well okay just fyi anyway so you tried that first step and you still have a black screen so next thing i want you to do is this i want you to go ahead and plug your phone in go ahead and let it charge just let it sit here for about five minutes okay after five minutes i'm going to come back to it and i want you to do the same thing i want you to force restart it while it's plugged in and while it's charging okay so power button here ready press and hold i'm going to continue hold pretend my screen is black here i don't know what's going on on here i'm still holding on to the power button i'm just waiting for that google logo to appear still holding it's coming there it is let go now hopefully you guys are up and running if not we're going to go to the next step okay so here's the next step here we're going to go ahead and unplug it and what we're going to do now is what i call the tap method because we're going to be tapping on the screen as well as the back a lot of times what happens is something um slightly gets dislodged and sometimes a couple taps will actually put it back and you'll never have a black screen again okay anyway so go ahead and grab two fingers hold your phone like this and what i want you to do is tap everywhere on the screen oh yeah fyi guys i'm not responsible if something happens uh to your phone okay so do everything at your own risk so i'm tapping all over here on the side on the screen turn it over and do the same thing okay you want to go ahead and tap it even on the uh the lens here sometimes even when you're tapping like the screen you may see some flashes or it may like blink or sometimes sometimes it just comes on automatically okay anyways you tapped it all over and it's still black now go ahead and do the force restart press and hold that power button do not let go until you see the google logo and hopefully you guys are up and running now if you're not we're going to go to the next step here now the next step here i call the massage method because we need to massage the phone you can go ahead and if you want to okay if you don't want to get here because what we're going to do is use two thumbs and we're going to press all over the screen and as well as the back if you don't want to mess up your get smudges and stuff on your screen you can use a paper towel or a napkin or something like that anyways go ahead and pick up the phone like this and then what we're going to do is start pressing in like this give it like a nice massage all over even on the corners here too okay get it on the corners give it a nice massage turn it over same thing on the back okay sometimes you got to put a little bit more pressure in there okay sometimes you can even hear like a little like a click or something like that and then you notice that your screen will pop up okay so even with massaging like this sometimes you'll see it flickered or flashed or sometimes it turns on okay or most of the times it'll still be black okay so after you massaged it and it's still black do the same thing again we want to go ahead and force restart it press and hold that power button don't let go until we see a google logo appear now hopefully you guys are up and running if not we're going to go to the next method and the next method i call the smack method because we're going to smack the phone so we want to do is hold out our palm like this and start off with the screen here you want to give it taps also on the bottom of the screen as well and again sometimes you'll start seeing something flash sometimes it'll turn on automatically magically just turn on so same thing on the back okay give it a couple whacks give it on the back front side as well and if it's still black do the same thing we want to go ahead and force restart it press and hold do not let go until we see the google local appear then we can let go alright now if you're still down the next thing i want you guys to do is this okay i want you to go ahead and plug your phone in again and leave it charging for 10 minutes okay after 10 minutes i want you to come back to your phone i want to unplug it and i want you to go to your refrigerator and i want you to put this actually in the freezer okay where it's freezing cold put your phone in the freezer just like that close the door and leave it in there for 10 minutes after 10 minutes up pull out the phone it's going to be nice and cold and do the same thing press and hold that power button do not let go until you see that google logo appear now most of you guys should be up and running now the thing is if you guys are still down start from the very beginning of the video and try every single step multiple times sometimes i mean there's times i tried six seven my eighth time it finally worked also remember if you guys have a uh case on here or a uh like a screen protector and your phone is still black you may want to go and take off the um your your case cover as well as your screen protector and try every single step multiple times anyway let me know what step works you work for you or that you think work for you sometimes it's a combination of two or three methods that get you up and running as well so this

      "transcript": "you're watching the google pixel 4a 5g disassembly let's go ahead and remove that sim tray the screen has to be removed first and in order to do that we have to apply heat using a hair dryer or a heat gun so we can loosen up the adhesive around the screen's frame and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off and one more thing to note you need to get your pry tool in between the glass and the plastic border of the screen so once you have the screen loose from the frame you're going to lift it up and away from the frame like so and your cable for the screen is still attached so you're going to have to disconnect that there's a tape over here i have to peel off there's also a cover over the connector we need to remove now we can disconnect the cable so here's your screen now that we have the screen removed we can see a large sheet of copper tape which is on top of the mid frame and there are nine torx t4 screws holding down the mid frame which need to be removed once the screws are removed you're going to put your pry tool in between the mid frame and the housing of the phone and you're going to separate the catches now once the housing is loose from the mid frame you're gonna flip it over and you can lift it up from the bottom up you have some cables over here connected still which you need to disconnect there are 10 more t4 screws which need to be removed now we can lift up and remove this metal cover here's a better look at that metal cover now it's time to disconnect the battery cable once we have that disconnected we can go ahead and disconnect the rest of the cables so here's your back housing and it is plastic you have your fingerprint reader over here there's the cable for it and this flex cable over here which leads to your secondary mic over here on top as well as the flash over here for the cameras and you also have numerous antenna contact points which are these gray lines around the housing you also have the two contacts over here for the nfc antenna right there you can see the outline and there's a large graphite film over here on the back which helps transfer heat when you pull the graphite film back you can see the nfc antenna which is rectangular piece over here and on the bottom of the housing where the speaker opening is and where the mic opening is there are mesh filters all right continuing with the disassembly we have a wire cable over here we need to disconnect just pop it off and then we can lift up and remove the speaker assembly so here's your speaker assembly and there's a small board over here which seems to be an antenna board right next to it it's a separate piece next there's a protective tape over here which needs to be peeled off so we can remove the front facing camera now time to disconnect the headphone jack and we have one more protective film over here which needs to be peeled off that's sitting on top of the earpiece speaker we're left with one more flex cable over here on the bottom and once that is connected you have a few catches around the main board holding it down so here's the main board there's copper tape on top of the shields and with the shields removed we can see a little bit of thermal paste which was over here on the shields which sit on top of some of the chips now here's a look at the back of the board we have your primary microphone located over here your charger port is located over here and it's connected with a flex cable so you can disconnect that by popping it off here's your charger port the cables for your cameras are located on the top you can just disconnect them by popping them off your proximity sensor is located over here and you have more copper tape located over here on top of this shield and once you remove the shields on this side you can see there's a thermal pad over here and there's one over here which goes on top of the processor and one over here which goes on top of the memory so back to the mid frame we have more copper tape over here which sits underneath the board we have your battery of course your vibrator motor is located over here you have this flex cable over here which runs along the side over here and it's for your volume keys and power button now as far as removing the battery goes on this side we have this cut out isn't copper tape if you pull those off there are adhesive pull tabs underneath which you can pull to release the battery these aren't the most friendly pull tabs once you have those adhesive strips removed you can just lift up and remove your battery here's a better look air battery and here's the mid frame all right now i'm going to go ahead and put the phone back together once everything back in place apply new adhesive and then replay your screen and then power on your phone and you're done i hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you guys want to see more videos like this make sure you subscribe and click on the

There's a small board over here which seems to be an antenna board right next to it it's a separate piece. On the bottom of the housing where the speaker opening is and where the mic opening is there are mesh filters. board holding it down so here's the main board there's copper tape on top of the shields and with the shields removed we can see a little bit of thermal paste which was over here on the shields. Once you remove the shields on this side you can see there's a thermal pad over here. motor is located over here you have this flex cable over here which runs along the side over here and it's for your volume keys and power button now as far as removing the battery goes on this side we have this cut out isn't copper tape if you pull those off there are adhesive pull tabs underneath which you can pull to release the battery. once you have those adhesive strips removed you can just lift up and remove your battery.",

      "transcript": "hello everyone this is matt from real world review and today we're going to replace the screen on the pixel 4a plus 5g this is very similar to the pixel 4a but actually a little bit easier so the tools we will need are going to be a razor blade a pick a playing card and some heat we'll also need some glue as well as some clamps so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to heat up the edges of the phone you pretty much want to just go around the actual screen itself and make sure not to focus too much on the front camera but you do want to make sure you get the heat pretty much all around the edges of the screen while it seems to be a little bit easier to start at the top right or the top left i'm going to start at the bottom left because there's no cracked glass down here but what i'm going to do is heat up the bottom just so i can get a razor blade in there to lift up the adhesive and then i'm going to get a playing card to cut through that adhesive i want to be careful with that card because i don't want to get in between the screen i just want to get under it so i got the playing card under the display and i'm just going to cut through the adhesive and i'm going to heat up that area on the top left and cut through the rest of that adhesive as well as you can see the screen powered on if it powers on just power off the phone that's fine but cut through the adhesive going up the top left and then the top right and you should be able to heat up the bottom like this and it should just kind of lift off a little bit easier feel free to use a playing card to cut through the adhesive on the bottom but if you're trying to preserve the oled like i was be very careful once it lifts off the frame you want to lift up the screen like this and you want to fold it down like this next there's this little cover that kind of goes over it they started putting out on the pixels i don't know why because there's this little plastic piece that you have to remove like this i recommend using a pick to do that then you want to carefully use the pick to unplug the display cable and then you're all set there next we can test the screen make sure everything's working looks like it is so we're going to turn off the phone take that off and we're going to remove all the adhesive that's on here and pretty much what you want to do is you want to get a razor blade to kind of cut through the adhesive and lift it up so then it's kind of flat around the edges and once we have that cleaned up what we're going to do is we're going to get the little earpiece thing we're going to remove it from the old screen and we're just going to set it on the new screen it should just fit in there but feel free to add just a very small amount of glue if it's not fitting in there properly now that everything's all cleaned up what we're going to do is we're going to plug in the display we're going to put this little plastic piece back on starting with the right side and clipping on to the left side then with the screen folded like this we're going to add some glue we're going to go around the edges skip over the little earpiece part and continue going down the bottom and down the sides and pretty much this glue is just going to go where the adhesive was before and then we're going to set down the screen like this and we're going to add some clamps make sure that all the edges are flat because sometimes the screen will move a little bit and you don't want it to cure while it's lifted up now there is one thing that i forgot to put back on this little piece all it does is just goes over that little plastic piece it's not that crucial but i did forget to put that in so make sure to put that in if you have that option now without we have the clamps on here we're gonna let that sit for about two to three hours after it's done drying we're gonna take off the clamps and we're gonna clean up the adhesive all you need to do is just use your fingers maybe your fingernails or possibly some alcohol some like rubbing alcohol that's all you really need to do you don't need to use any metal or anything like that to remove it but once that's all cleaned up you're all set hopefully this video helped you out if you have any questions leave them in the comment section or message me on twitter i get bored over there feel free to follow me on the social media listed above subscribe to my channel so you can see more repair videos and some review videos and hit that bell button so that youtube reminds you when those videos do come out thanks for watching",

Don't get in between the screen i just want to get under it so i got the playing card under the display. Cut through the adhesive going up the top left and then the top right. Heat up the bottom like this and it should just kind of lift off a little bit easier. want to carefully use the pick to unplug the display cable and then you're all set there next we can test the screen make sure everything's working looks like it is. We're going to turn off the phone take that off and we'regoing to remove all the adhesive that's on here and pretty much what you want to do is youwant to get a razor blade to kind of cut through the adhesive and lift it up. add some glue we're going to go around the edges skip over the little earpiece part and continue going down the bottom and down the sides. We're gonna let that sit for about two to three hours after it's done drying. need to use any metal or anything like that to remove it. Once that's all cleaned up you're all set.",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Screen Replacement for BEGINNERS | How to Repair",
      "transcript": "today I'm going to teach you guys how to repair the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra check this thing out the back of the phone is just completely shattered and the front screen got just ripped off this full screen replacement and back glass replacement is probably going to take me about 45 minutes and I'm going to show you guys every step of the way let's get right into a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra all right so here we have the Samsung Note 20 Ultra as you can see the back glass is shattered I don't know how this broke I didn't ask him questions some guy brought it in and he said he's actually wants to get this fixed so he can give it to an older friend of his so he already has another phone he said he bought but he says this one still works it's a little bit bent I think that's where it broke right here you see like there's kind of like a dent right there I don't know maybe it like fell between the door and he closed it on there and then this front screen got ripped off but anyways for an example because I do sell these in my store I sell refurbished phones so this is how it's gonna look after the repair so here's a Samsung Note 20 Ultra this still has a wrapper on it right so this phone is somehow gonna turn and look like something like this so let's get into the parts that I'm going to use so here's the new back glass it's easy to put on all you do is just take this off and slap a new back on there right but here's the front screen and for those of you guys that want to know like where to get these parts I'm going to start linking putting links in my YouTube videos underneath in the description so you guys can um just click and just buy if you guys if this is the phone that you're fixing or if this happens to be one of your phones right all right so this is what they call a service pack and a service pack already has a screen protector already installed on the phone if you can see there you go you see here's the cutout for the little front uh for the front camera right there but this screen protector is already perfectly installed onto this phone and yeah here's the fingerprint scanner this phone the fingerprint comes like right there so how much am I charging for this repair and how much and are do these parts cost for me for this on this particular day so I'm charging 375 dollars for this repair this screen right here actually costs 236 dollars this back glass right here with this already installed on it with a camera with this little camera thing on there costs twelve dollars so in total I'm gonna make a hundred and twenty seven dollars on this repair alone this repair generally takes me like 45 minutes all right let me clear the table and let's get this started all right so the first thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to take off this back cover and generally the way that I take off back covers on Samsung phones is by using this tool right here and poker playing cards but as you guys see this thing is just shattered Beyond whatever right first take out this Galaxy S Pen right here because I'm going to heat up the phone and you don't want to heat up the the S Pen so take that out put it to the side now let's heat up the back of the phone thank you all right so here's the back cover so even though this is shattered we actually need something off of here so as you can see there's like a little microchip right there so what we're gonna do is take that little chip off right here it looks like it's a microphone for a for the camera and we're just gonna it's just gonna transfer onto right there all right but we'll do that later in the uh in the video when I go to put this new back glass back onto the phone all right so the first thing we're going to want to do is take out a whole bunch of screws there's probably like 20 of them here all down here and right here don't take the ones off the sides like the 5G antennas right here sometimes these screws are hard to take out too all right so we got all the screws out now we are going to take off these plastic pieces okay so first we're going to want to unplug this right here see this unplug that this thing will come out like this just grab it oh unplug this right here now this thing will come out you can kind of grab this like this now we're going to take out this bottom uh loudspeaker we're going to grab a tool like this there we go just like this so this whole piece will come out just like this with the loudspeaker and everything right we'll put this right here and we're going to take this thing out right here so we're going to look where there's connections right you see a connection right here that looks like it's the camera flash or something like that then this thing will kind of come up and then as you can see this looks like it's an ear speaker right here and yeah the camera flash I believe put that here we'll actually put this stuff to the side we don't need this to look at this anymore so we'll put it aside we'll also put these screws in this dish right here and get these screws out of the way they're all the same size all these screws are the same size doesn't matter if you get mixed then mixed up all right so what do we have next right here let's just start unconnecting stuff actually here's the gonna be the game plan as you guys see here's the rest of the phone here's the uh new screen right so basically the game plan is to take everything out of here and just put it in here right that's going to be your whole thing right there but first I want to see if this phone really does still work so we're gonna connect the the screen in right now and we're gonna see if this phone actually boots up and everything so I'm going to unplug the battery here's the screen connection right here I'm going to take this connection because this is a screen and plug it right into the motherboard right here all right so plug the battery back in right here and then push the power you're going to want to hold push down right here because the way that this is gonna turn on is it makes contact right there you go so remember that guys if you guys have no experience if you push the power button it's not going to do anything because the motherboard is not making contact with the power button so you push down into it that's why you put the screws back and it does that for you all right so we're gonna test the screen out a little bit I'm going to touch the numbers and stuff make sure the Screen Works phone works perfectly fine here it is I'm sure he's going to wipe this phone out before he gives it to his friend so so what I'll do is just power off the phone I'll just unplug the battery here see and then just unplug the screen and this repair is a go right so you see this plastic piece right here put this back onto the phone because there's probably some glass little shards of tiny dust particles of glass that's on here that you can't see right and then what happens is if this plastic piece is off you start rubbing this right here and you start scratching the screen I found out about that when I in my coffee shop days because I actually did that with somebody's phone and I I didn't realize what I was doing right so always put the plastic piece back on when you're working on the phone okay so now let's begin the repair so what we're going to do is we're gonna want to unplug connections we're gonna unplug this unplug this unplug this unplug this and we're going to start one by one removing stuff from here and then placing it here okay so the what we're gonna wanna I'm gonna do first is you see the screw right here take that out and we're gonna start one by one we're gonna transfer this thing over right here so take out that screw take this thing out right here we're gonna take out these two screws where the charging port is right here see here's the other screw right here now I'm going to blow some heat right here I'm going to blow Heat the reason why I blow heat is because this charging port has a little bit of sticky stuff underneath under it and I'm going to grab my flat tool like this this is not a screwdriver or anything it's like kind of like a plastic kind of black stick and I get right under it and I scoop right under it and then this thing will come out like that there you go so you don't want to cut this thing right here see this thing right here you don't want to cut it that's why I slide the tool like this I go underneath it right underneath it and then kind of twist and lift this thing up a little bit all right so then we're going to want to take out the vibration motor right here and I'm gonna blow heat on it all right so here's my flathead screwdriver I'm gonna get underneath this like right down here on the side and just pluck this out like that usually the adhesive is still stuck on there like this one is you see it's still stuck on there if it's not and it's on here still and just cut out a piece of tape you don't want this thing jiggling around when it vibrates right the way that it works is something in there is spinning around like this boom you know how your uh remote like your Nintendo controllers or whatever something spins that's how it vibrates right it does the same thing in there so we're gonna put this right here there we go there it is we're gonna put the charging port in next flip it around make sure it fits in there there you go and then we're gonna put the two screws back in then we're gonna put this thing right here I don't really know what this is but it's for something right so we're gonna place this right back here and then this thing also has a screw to hold it down here's a screw see this right there so there's the whole bottom piece right here that's all in so now we we tackled that area right so the next thing that we're going to want to do is take out this whole motherboard and we're just going to take it out like this so we're gonna you see these connections right here we're just gonna unplug unplug this unplug that unplug this unplug the front selfie camera and remember this SIM tray eject this SIM tray thing right here should be already out of the phone and what you're going to want to do to take this motherboard out is you're going to kind of wiggle it out so you're gonna find a spot there it is came out just like that this is actually your Samsung Note 20 Ultra phone everything else everything that you see here is connected in here you see all these connections boom boom boom battery everything all these connections plug into here camera plugs into here the 5G antennas plug into here everything plugs into here everything runs off of this this is the brains right so we'll put that here so as you can see we're we're almost I would say 40 of the way done already all right so the next thing I'm going to want to do is I'm going to want to transfer the 5G antennas which are right here it's held down by two screws and then there's one over here on this side there's two 5G antennas so let's start transferring one by one we'll start off with this one on the right we took out the two screws I'm gonna blow a little bit of heat around this area because there's a little bit of adhesive that's stuck underneath it that's holding the 5G antenna there all right so we're gonna grab this little ice sesimo tool they call it right here we're going to kind of see if this thing lifts out well this thing was already out I guess wasn't hard see there's adhesive on there that's how it's sticking on my finger right it's a little bit warm too so we're just gonna put this right back in here there we go it fit all the way in right there and grab our two screws and screw the screws back in all right so before we do the other one hold on so I'm just calling all right I'm back I recording this during my stores open so you see these uh plastic pieces these are nothing just this thing is goes in the garbage right also with this let's just get this out of the way so it's not confusing this little thing there we go also this thing right here here's another like wrapper kind of thing that's covering there you go toss this out okay so we're going to take off this 5G antenna and just transfer it all right so that's done so now we have the 5G antennas installed this bottom Port part installed so what do we really have to do what's what's left the battery and the front selfie camera that's all we have to do to transfer over why don't we start with the front selfie camera this is kind of tricky because the way that they do these on the newer Samsung phones you'll see that there's kind of like a silicone they put around the camera right here to hold it in in place and it's kind of hard to get out so the way that I get this thing out is I use a pair of tweezers like this sharp tweezers and I slide in to the side don't damage the camera right don't rip this thing just get around the side like kind of break the seal right here I'll just show you look grab the straight side first we'll start on the right there it is lift up a little bit now go right here on the side remember don't pierce the camera with this go through just like this like that I don't know if you can see it I'll grab this see if this thing can lift out yet kind of wiggle it around see if it moves there we go it's coming out there we go see see the silicone on the sides some of it's probably left here yeah there it is see that that's the silicone that's on the side right there okay sometimes when you get this there's kind of some silicone that's in there if you're buying a refurbished screen just pluck it out on the screen that you got okay we'll put the front selfie camera aside and always use your original parts sometimes these phones used to come with their own cameras but the cameras didn't work always use the original parts from your phone and transfer them over all right so the last thing that we need to do to get out of this is we're gonna have to take out this battery the way that I take out this battery is I blow kind of heat on this side as you can see there's no screen I forgot about this and then we'll use alcohol so I'm going to use alcohol this is just regular stuff that I got from CVS 91 alcohol I'm gonna put it right here pour some here as you can see pour some on the side right here holy crap this thing came out dude why the hell did that happen all right top fell off all right all right so we'll let it sit a little bit kind of let it marinate we'll grab this tool right here and we'll kind of lift up so the whole game plan is to try not to bend the battery it's already kind of bent a little bit because I remember that little Kink on the side but we'll go here on the side and we'll just lift and I could already feel the battery lifting up a little bit maybe lift it up a little now I can place some more alcohol underneath move it around underneath the battery and then lift again probably get this tool right here get it under there and then just grab this batter and just pull it out there we go I gotta answer the phone but look at this battery all right so there's alcohol on the battery on the back so we're just going to wipe that off with the rag there's alcohol in here kind of wipe that out we actually don't need anything else from this phone if you see some connections right here this phone already has these connections right here this connection is for the the S Pen Flex cable that goes underneath the entire screen this right here is for the uh S Pen which there's already it already has its own S Pen connection already installed onto the new screen see this piece right here is this piece right here so that's it there's the power button thing this already has its own buttons and power stuff already installed this is junk this is crap we do not need this anymore put this aside all right so let's focus on this let me completely dry this battery of any other alcohol now sometimes alcohol does get into this little hole right here and if it does I want you to blow it out because the alcohol will blow out the other side so like actually like blow it out put it by your mouth and blow the alcohol out see how some of the alcohol came out so what we're going to want to do is put this motherboard right right in here go like this get underneath the connections place that in there like that get your front selfie camera install that plug it back in here's some silicone on here okay this silicone is getting in the way so I gotta take this off all right let's see if it fits in there now not quite yet holy crap look what I was telling you guys I mentioned this this thing has freaking silicone in there I didn't even see it that's why it wouldn't fit in there so take this silicone out there you go this is from the old screen because this this Frame is original so it's probably buffed out of all scratches and it's it's probably a refurbished frame so you see that take that out that's why the camera wouldn't fit in there right all right now it fits in there look and then plug it in there it is I felt it plugging with my fingers all right that's in now all we have to do can silicone all right uh we're going to install the battery on here let me get some adhesive and I'll show you all right so sometimes this comes with adhesive here but in this case on this Frame it didn't come with any so we have to cut our own strips of adhesive this is double side adhesive I actually buy this stuff on eBay it's just called red cell phone tape this is what the uh five milliliters I I guess I don't know what they call it we're gonna take the battery just rub out any of these folding parts kind of make this flat area back here all right we'll just place this in here just like that place that in there we'll plug in these connections right here plugged in plug this in up here you guys heard it click we'll plug this one in down here I felt it go in all right plug in the 5G antenna where is this did I put this in backwards oh my God I freaking did I put this in backwards all right so I got to take out the 5G antenna and just turn it that way that's why this thing was hard to put in when I was first putting it in okay there we go put it this way all right and then this thing goes just like that there you go then these things plug in right here that plugs in there this thing plugs in down here we'll put the two screws back to hold it down all right put the other one there that is the first time I've ever done that and put it backwards but I mean obviously you'll know if you put it in backwards because you won't be able to plug in the connections right because they're at they're different sizes right so all right all right so then we'll plug in these three these three right here there's this one right here for the S Pen plug that in plug in this one and then plug in this one I always double check make sure I can feel it with my nail like that we can go ahead and plug in the battery right now plug in the battery is plugged in everything's in all this stuff is in okay we're almost done so we'll plug this thing in we'll start at the bottom flip it around like this we'll get this out of the way all right so we'll plug this in bottom first kind of pops in this thing is not popping in on the bottom so take it out and put it back in again there we go there we go there we go now it's all plugged in it wasn't popping in in this area down here so I took it out and put it right back in all right so that's in we can now put this thing in first because this is going to overlap onto this piece right so we're gonna put this top there it is see this connection let's pop in let's plug it in that's plugged in this thing is going to overlap like this right and then there's two connections right here this one and this one right I'm gonna lay it on here and we're going to plug this in and we're

dummy proof things how to install it right here these little Notch points so the way I'm going to take this off is I'm going to blow heat on this side I'm gonna get this I'm going to slide this underneath there we go as you will see this thing still has adhesive that's the mic the adhesive still around that piece and then we'll just grab the new back and just install it you see how there's a kind of like a cutout right here let me get on that there's a cutout place this just like this there we go so it aligns perfectly there you go so you can just slap this back cover on like this but the thing is I know that this for this particular phone this is not enough adhesive we're almost done though as you can see I'm gonna put some more adhesive around this right here so now we're just gonna

      "summary": "today I'm going to teach you guys how to repair the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. The back of the phone is just completely shattered and the front screen got just ripped off this full screen replacement and back glass replacement is probably going to take me about 45 minutes. do sell these in my store I sell refurbished phones so this is how it's gonna look after the repair. I'm going to start linking putting links in my YouTube videos underneath in the description so you guys can um just click and just buy. already perfectly installed onto this phone and yeah here's the fingerprint scanner this phone the fingerprint comes like right there. So I'm charging 375 dollars for this repair this screen right here actually costs 236 dollars this back glass right here with this already installed on it with a camera with this little camera thing on there costs twelve dollars so in total I'm gonna make a hundred and twenty seven dollars on this repair alone. Here's the back cover so even though this is shattered we actually need something off of here so as you can see there's like a little microchip right there so what we're gonna do is take that little chip off right here it looks like it's a microphone for a for the camera. to want to unplug this right here see this unplug that this thing will come out like this just grab it oh unplug it right here now. We'll also put these screws in this dish right here and get these screws out of the way they're all the same size all these screws. are the same size doesn't matter if you get mixed then mixed up all right so what do we have next right here let's just start unconnecting stuff actually. if you push the power button it's not going to do anything because the motherboard is not making contact with the powerbutton so you push down into it that's why you put the screws back and it does that for you. I didn't realize what I was doing right so always put the plastic piece back on when you're working on the phone okay so now let's begin the repair. We're going to start one by one removing stuff from here and then placing it here. and I get right under it and I scoop right underIt and then this thing will come out like that there you go. Usually the adhesive is still stuck on there like this one is. You don't want this thing jiggling around when it vibrates. does the same thing in there so we're gonna put the charging port in next flip it around make sure it fits in there there you go. Next thing that we're going to want to do is take out this whole motherboard and we're just going to take it out like this. kind of wiggle it out so you're gonna find a spot there it is came out just like that this is actually your Samsung Note 20 Ultra phone everything else everything that you see here is connected in here. all right so we're gonna grab this little ice sesimo tool they call it right here we're going to kind of see if this thing lifts out well this thing was already out I guess wasn't hard see there's adhesive on there. part installed so what do we really have to do what's what's left the battery and the front selfie camera that's all we have toDo to transfer over. The way that they do these on the newer Samsung phones you'll see that there's kind of like a silicone they put around the camera. Always use your original parts sometimes these phones used to come with their own cameras but the cameras didn't work always use the original parts from your phone and transfer them over. The last thing that we need to do to get out of this is we're gonna have to take out this battery. out dude why the hell did that happen all right top fell off all right all right so we'll let it sit a little bit kind of let it marinate we'll grab this tool right here and we'll kind of lift up so the whole game plan is to try not to bend the battery. connections right here this connection is for the the S Pen Flex cable that goes underneath the entire screen. This is junk this is crap we do not need this anymore put this aside all right so let's focus on this. install that plug it back in here's some silicone on here okay this silicone is getting in the way so I gotta take this off all right let's see if it fits in there now not quite yet. this is double side adhesive I actually buy this stuff on eBay it's just called red cell phone tape this is what the uh five milliliters I I guess I don't know what they call it we're gonna take the battery just rub out any of these folding parts kind of make this flat area back here. other one there that is the first time I've ever done that and put it backwards but I mean obviously you'll know if you put it in backwards because you won't be able to plug in the connections right because they're at they're different sizes right. right back in all right so that's in we can now put this thing in first because this is going to overlap onto this piece right so we're gonna put this top there it is see this connection let's pop in let's plug it in that's plugged in. dummy proof things how to install it right here these little Notch points. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G phone repair screen repair and back glass. replacement guys remember link for parts look in the description.

      "title": "How To Replace Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G Screen | VERY  EASY WAY",
      "transcript": "welcome back to my channel as you can see this is almost new samsung galaxy note 20 ultra 5g this is not 20 ultra 5g problem is the screen heated in here and completely it's uh out of work now okay so we must need to change it okay so we've got the replacement part i'm going to show you so that's the actual replacement part the screen comes with the body the whole housing so that's mean we have to pull out every single component from here and put it back in here and the back cover on put the battery in back cover on and the job would be done okay so this job it seems like very hard to do but it's so simple it just takes time you know you you should have patient with it and slowly slowly you can do that okay so let's start first i'm going to put it in here so first what we're going to do we're going to take out the sim tray that is the first thing good and now with this hair dryer i'm gonna apply heat right so it seems this is hot enough so now what are you gonna do we're gonna make a gap with the flat opening tool like this very easy to damage so be gentle and be careful put the paper in and just try to cut the glue so right so that's the back camera i'm gonna leave it inside the pack just to keep it dust free yeah so now slowly slowly we must need to disconnect all of them one by one okay by removing the screws one uh all right so this side is done gently pull this out before we do that disconnect it first it is disconnected and try to take this out while you do that make sure you disconnect the connector result it's very fine where need to be very careful gently pull this out right what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take this screw off so now take this out yeah this one came out as you can see put it on the side now first thing is disconnect the battery then the main one by one never touch these uh lamps otherwise you're gonna you're gonna damage the actual quality of the camera because you can clean it the way it is right now disconnect all of them don't forget about this legs also this one as well absolutely fine now let's check how we can take this out that part as well now we need to check if there is any screw and stuff i don't see any more screws here i think this one should come out with the it is no much more difficult can just take this out like that as you can see that's the main board leave it on the side okay so now this part already been clear now we need to work out in this side disconnect it don't pull this because this one attached to the uh actual charging port okay don't forget there are two screws one screw on the board which is right here and then two screws into the pole super simple so now from here we must need to remove the board first this is the primary cable and try to take this out as you can see this is super simple now we're going to take out this flex okay you need to be very careful go underneath the flex can you see that so i push this one if you use any metal tool you need to be very careful i'm doing it for so long so that's why i know how to control you know in your case if this is first time it's always best to use the plastic one okay so that is down to now we need to remove from here the battery and the vibrator thanks so the battery attached with very strong adhesive underneath i'm going to show you how difficult it is to remove it's not easy as you can see so the best way is to apply some pcb cleaner okay so add in here give a little bit of time a lot of tutorial it shows like this is so easy they put it and open it definitely those videos are posed video you know most of them so be careful don't feel like it's going to be super easy because just to make the video shorter or to make it more professional might be some people they cut it they don't show the actual real time how much it takes to remove the battery from the old phone and to put it back into the new one okay so make sure you have passion and you do spend some times with it it's coming out slowly yep it's become so easy slowly and gently yeah we did not pause the video as you can see okay so it seems like that has already melted down okay don't forget to make it flat with this flat part you know if there is any bubble it's gonna make a disturbance for the reapplication okay so i can see this is absolutely fine compared to such a big phone this is kind of very small battery you know they could make the battery little bit more bigger because this one it shows 4370 million okay this is quite small if they wanted they could make it much bigger to save you know more energy in there okay so that is also removed now if you compare the new replacement we can't see there is anything different because the volume button comes with it your speaker also comes with it but still i don't know about year one you must need to check what is included what is now okay so i'm going to observe it from top to bottom i can see your speaker your speaker here volume up and down volume up and down touch then the fan panel yes pen panel also in here okay so almost that's all you know okay so now it's fine we can remove this we don't see anything else to take out from here okay so now what you can do you need to peel this off there are a lot of stickers and stuff peel this off i don't know why they use this sort of sticker let me double check if there is anything missing no it's absolutely fine yeah it's absolutely fine now it's okay take this warranty sticker okay now first is first what are you gonna do we're gonna put the motherboard in okay that's the motherboard don't touch the camera the first thing is push that side in first okay don't forget all the flex i don't see any more flex in here as you can see this one went in straight away without any trouble absolutely brilliant connect all of them one by one good yes so so absolutely fine now the actual charging port and before you do that make sure you put this one back second one is the battery we don't need to reapply the glue because it seems that is fine now we need to put this back tonight absolutely fine super simple you know just take a little bit of time and understanding like you know what you are doing so now if you close that one it's going to block the way of the battery as well so we must need to connect the battery so simple good if you want you can put back all the screws in here it doesn't go in we must need to check where is the problem definitely there is a problem let me check if there is anything any gap now so don't over tighten the screw because that way it might damage your main boat see how simple it is what he can do we can give it a check by turning on the power as you can see the power is coming on that's mean everything connected properly now we're going to check the touch if the touch is fine then the job will be done by the way i'm trying to add some double sided tape just for the back cover okay so before we peel this off we're gonna double check we're gonna go to emergency because we don't know the password vibration everything seems fine so now i'm gonna peel this off that is the advantage of keeping the bathtub protected without any dirt and stuff you know and as you can see this is a little bit messy what we can do we can just cut it because we reapplied anyway okay and this side is on we can put this back and everything should be back to normal as you can see yeah it's a kind of brand new phone don't forget like me it's fine now we're going to test the charge because that is most important because we remove the charging board and we pull it out so we just want to make sure there is no damage happen that's the charging port it's charging fast charging everything seems fine so now if you remove it we can check it's the brand new phone s20 ultra 5g so that's how you change change the complete screen panel for samsung no 20 ultra 5g it's super simple it seems very easy a lot of tasks in there you need to change this and that you know you need to pull this out but it's not too hard as i told you very you know patiently if you do it it's super simple let me tell you some clue for this first thing never touch the camera lens the actual camera lens never touch it when you take out the back cover put it in a safe place don't contact with too much dust because later on you have to clean it and you never can clean like a factory you know and then when you pull out the all the flexes be gentle and you know the actual wireless panel nfc panel when you pull this out there are two three connectors so two connectors definitely you need to be careful first you need to pull this down so when i open the nfc part i mean wireless uh charging pot i just took the front panel fast and the back okay when i pull the back i just pull out the actual you know inside mid frame because then i don't have to remove the glue tape and stuff like that follow step by step and do it if you have any difficulty if you have any question let me know in the comment section and this video will be you know it's not only for the screen replacement that will be enough for replacing the battery whatever you want to do because this is a kind of heart surgery you know so thank you so much for watching guys i hope i will see you in the next video and don't forget to like and subscribe see you again bye for now thank you you",

      "transcript": "welcome to a new Croc fixed video today and let's see how to replace your battery on your Samsung Note 20 Ultra smartphone if you need any parts or tools I have provided the links in the video description just click under more under the video okay so this is our phone or Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra let's see how to open this phone and replace the battery so first what are you going to do is take your heat gun and heat up the back cover I'm using here at about 180 to 200 degrees Celsius and heating up the back cover for maybe about okay as you see I'm using 220 degrees so sorry about that uh and I'm using the it for maybe a minute or two just to soften the glue underneath and to better and easily open it especially uh take care and don't heat up too much uh at the camera area otherwise you could also damage the camera okay now I'm trying to make a gap between the back cover and the middle frame and for this I'm using here a suction cup and you only need to do here just a little small Gap so you can put your fingernail in or just a plastic cart so uh work slowly here as you see I'm trying to put my fingernail here because it's easier and more more convenient for me but uh you work like a thing is the best for you and keep in mind that always work carefully so maybe the glue is not soft enough so I'm heating it up a little bit more foreign tape is really really strong so you will think that you don't even move for a millimeter so but you tried two or three times and then you will do a gap like I did then use a plastic card or a cart whichever card made from plastic the best thing is you don't use any metal things otherwise you could damage it then you go and cut the adhesive tape under the back cover don't uh press it too much out don't lift it too much otherwise you could break it because it's made from glass carefully work around and cut all the corners foreign and as you see the glue is still remaining on it that's good now we are going to remove all these screws here and then remove the back plate with also disassembling the the metal plate and disconnecting the small connector here the flex cable okay then let's remove the SIM card tray what a theme card if you have any okay now we are going to remove the pen here the S Pen and now let's try to lift up this metal plate which is also the wireless charging system so work carefully here and disconnect also the flex cable which was connected here try to slowly lift up the um this side down is has a little bit adhesive tape but it's easy to remove then you will need to disconnect the battery and then all these Flex cables there are three remaining flask Flex cables here so disconnect carefully all and use a plastic pry tool so what I'm going to do now is I lift up this all Flex cables carefully they are not very soft they could also be broken so you have to be careful here so once are all tied together I will use some um tape adhesive tape to um yeah to glue them to the other side as you will see so they won't bother me when I will remove the battery some carefully gluing them here all tight first like this okay so now they are safe they won't Bend back and it will be easier to remove the battery to remove the battery I'm using here a small uh plastic cart uh and then also we need to use some alcohol the alcohol will soften the glue under the battery and it will be easier to remove so pure it in and let it work for you you will need to wait maybe for a minute or two or maybe three uh that the glue under the battery will become softener you can move your phone a little bit and pure a little bit more alcohol underneath and just move it in all the corners so we can go everywhere under the battery now you will need a small pry tool and two for lifting up the battery here so the best thing is uh you use something like I did uh it shouldn't be sharp otherwise you could damage the battery so the best is the pry tool for removing batteries like you see here you can order one in the video link description which I provided so lift it up as you see the alcohol did some work underneath and once you lift it up you can help yourself with another hand and then you put the plastic card under the battery here so it has to go underneath don't cut the battery so you have to lift it up with a tool and then you go with a plastic card underneath if you're lucky then that has if will get loose really fast and easily and the battery will be easier to remove so just give yourself time don't work too fast you see I can lift the battery more so you can just quickly remove it that's great so this tape actually don't need to be removed you can leave it and you can remove the leftover adhesive which was under the battery I will show you how to remove that now uh uh which is pretty easy you can use your fingers but just wait a second okay so now let's remove this all leftovers from the glue so you can stick your battery better in wood new adhesive of course so clean it nicely maybe use some alcohol and that's it I actually taped the flex cables again here okay there we have our battery so just remove the adhesive protectors here if you have blue ones then remove the blue one I have red ones just that you will stick the battery in there we go now we are going to stick in the battery so carefully align it and then gently press it everywhere in the corner to stick it in then you can press a little bit harder so the adhesive tape will hold like it should now remove this tape here there we go okay tape is removed and now we are going to assemble it First Connect all the flex cables so the first connector here touch it twice to make sure it's connected and then this one okay and then the last connector here and of course as well the battery so the battery is always last there we go okay now we take the upper metal plate together with the wireless charging connects the flex cable here put it in place align it connect it okay there we go I will Zoom here a little bit in to show you better and then put it in place and the screws are already waiting for you you connect also the bottom adhesive I mean it was already glued so no worries and then take your screws and screw all the stuff together into the frame okay so now I will take here the duster dust all I mean blow up uh blow out the Dust to make it clean so no dust will be on the camera lens there we go so I'm taking here a new back cover as it was ordered so if you have the old back cover you can reuse the adhesive tape or you just put some t7000 or b7000 glue over it and put it in place okay so one final cleaning attempt here to remove all the dust with this blower and then we are good to go this is our brand new back cover for the note 20 Ultra so let's remove here first the protector for the back length for the back glass and here the protector for the double-sided adhesive tape okay perfect so just one cleaning attempt for the last time here just in case but it's pretty new so yeah now we are going to put it in place so be carefully here maybe you work first from the top and press it gently down inside the frame so it's perfectly aligned and then go with your fingers and press it in all corners everywhere so the adhesive tape will be strong enough and hold like it should at the end you take one cloth and then you also go everywhere because it's easier it's uh more convenient and you press also in every Corners around for better holding you have to make your work perfect so just take your time as this video was made from a second video you will see a brand new screen and a back cover as well but the most important you have changed the battery and you saw how it's done thanks for watching if the video did somehow help you then you can buy me a coffee donations are always appreciated thank you you find the donation Link in my about page and in the video description please also like comment

need to remove on the bottom once those screws are removed gently heat the front of the phone up a little bit so you can loosen up adhesive underneath the screen and then go ahead and use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off but be careful the screen cables located on the bottom right hand corner so you don't want to damage out or cut it by accident now you're going to lift your screen up from the left to the right you have seven foot screws you need to remove so you can remove the metal plates covering the connectors once the screws are off we can remove the metal plates now the first thing we wanted this connect is a battery cable next we can disconnect the rest of the cables attach the screen assembly now if you want to remove the battery you have to pull tabs on the bottom you basically pull those tabs off and press the adhesive underneath the battery off you also have two more tabs on top once you pulled all the tabs off you just lift up and remove the battery so comparing the 20/20 iPhone se battery cable to the iPhone 8 battery cable the connector on the battery for the iPhone se is slightly larger than the one from the iPhone 8 so even though they're the same size battery they're not interchangeable so you can see the iPhone se in red and iPhone 8 in black on the left they're both pretty much identical design wise and lick wise all the internal components look the same so we already know the batteries aren't interchangeable let's take a look at the cameras so in order to remove the main camera or the camera which is on the back you have one mounting screw and one Phillips screw holding on the plate that's covering the camera which you need to remove once the screws are removed you can lift up the metal plate cover in the camera remove it and then you'll be able to disconnect the camera cable and then you bit to remove the camera so here's the camera from the 20/20 iPhone se and this is a camera from the iPhone 8 so I got the iPhone 8 camera here and the se over here let's pop in the iPhone 8 camera in the SC and test it out go ahead and reconnect your screen cables once all your screen cables are connected connect your battery cable and then we're going to power on the phone all right cellphones on let's go ahead and open up the camera cameras working fine let's go ahead and flip the camera so you can see the cameras working fine so the screen from the iPhone 8 also works on the iPhone se and a touch ID isn't working since it's from the iPhone 8 and it's not matching the boyfriend iPhone se that's on the screen so pretty much all the parts from the 20/20 iPhone se are the same as the iPhone 8 and are interchangeable so you'll be able to use the iPhone 8 parts for example the cameras charger port speaker the vibrator motor or on the iPhone 8 and on the 20/20 iPhone se the only thing that isn't interchangeable and you can't use from the iPhone 8 on the 20/20 iPhone se is the battery or let's continue to disassembly let's disconnect the rest of the cables two Phillips screws on the top over you have to remove there's one right here and there's one on the inside where the frame is once the screws are removed disconnect this flex cable from the board and then you can remove this piece you have seven screws on top in this area if they remove 6mm are here and one is on the frame on the inside right there if they remove all those what's the screws are removed you can remove these covers you now have one more Philips screw underneath you need to remove and then we're gonna remove this piece that won't cable here we need to disconnect at this point you're left with three stand-up screws to remove the mainboard once your standoffs screws are removed you have one more Philips screw over here in the corner you need to remove so I could remove this bracket right here that's over the mainboard once you remove that flip screw you can lift up and remove this bracket which looks to be holding that antenna cable or something now before you can remove the mainboard you have one more Philips screw hiding underneath this foam padding right here once that screws removed you can finally lift up and remove the mainboard there's a better look at your mainboard you have a graph I film covering both sides next winner will this bracket down here you have one tripod screw over here and two Phillips screws you need to remove and remove this bracket now that one connector here we have to disconnect once you disconnect that connector you have two Phillips screws need to remove one on this corner and one over here now that those screws are removed you can lift up and remove the speaker assembly here's a better location for assembly next we have two Phillips screws here we need to remove so we can remove that plastic bracket we now have six Phillips screws we need to remove on the bottom portion and we have one standoffs right there we need to remove two of the six Phillips screws are on the inside of the frame XL charger for it once you remove your screws you have two microphones which are held on with adhesive make sure you pry them off the frame at this point we can peel off the flex cable for the charger port this is your taptic feedback engine or your vibrator motor right here and it's connected underneath this cable over here so you can disconnect this flex cable by popping it up once you disconnect it it's held on with the adhesive to the bottom of this cable so you'd be able to pry them off and remove them your charger port has a rubber gasket around it so I just point you're left with the frame you have your volume key jewelry here and your vibrator rocker over here the flex cable for that runs over here there's the connector for the board you also connect to your power button switch over here and your flash for your camera now for the screen we've got ten triplane screws six of which are on the sides and you got four on the bottom over here where the fingerprint reader is you also have six Phillips screws on the top portion over here by the speaker on camera let's go ahead and remove these covers now in order to remove this back plate over here there's adhesive over here underneath on one of the cables so you're gonna have to pry that off you can disconnect your fingerprint scanner down here and then there's some adhesive holding down this cable as well so pry it off gently so you don't damage the cable every reader comes out like that no can remove the speaker on top and you're left with your approximately Center on top over here along with your camera over here and you want to remove this you just have to pry off this cable over here same thing that's held on with adhesive so just put a flat tool and wreath it and just pry it off all right now we're going to go ahead and put the foam back together and once everything's back in place power on your phone and you're done hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you guys want to see

      "title": "iPhone SE 2020 Screen Replacement Guide - Fix Your Phone Screen at Home!",
      "transcript": "welcome back to another idor UK video in this video I'm going to show you how to replace the screen on the iPhone SE 2020 Begin by pressing and holding the volume up button and power button to turn the device off then take a pentalobe screwdriver and remove the two bottom screws to secure the screen down I've seen lots of people use lots of different techniques to open these devices but I found that the easiest way is to get a single-sided razor blade and create a small gap between the chassis and the edge of the screen then pry upwards with the razor blade to create a larger Gap just enough to get the plastic opening pick in a couple of millim and then we can slide the pick along the right hand Edge the bottom Edge and the left hand Edge you don't need to worry about the top Edge cuz we're going to lift from the bottom now give the phone a wiggle and open up the device this one's clearly been opened before and you might find that there's some adhesive Still Remains but we'll clear that up later now that we're into the phone we need to remove this Shield here that's held down by four cross head screws of different sizes so just make sure that you make a note of where each screw comes out from it's easiest if you use a magnetic mat to keep screws organized if you don't have a magnetic mat you can use something like a piece of blue tack or just a small storage box once those four screws are removed we can lift off the shield using some tweezers and then using a plastic pramee tool we're going to isolate power from the device by disconnecting the battery from the motherboard we can then disconnect these two connectors here and then that frees up the digitizer and home button Flex cables we then need to move up to the top of the device now where there's another three crossed screws just be aware that these aren't always magnetic remove the three screws that hold this shield down use tweezers again to lift up the shield and then using the prime tool I'm just going to get underneath this Flex cable here to pop off the front camera and a speaker Flex cable that allows us to remove the screen now and we'll put the chassis to one side and come back to that later next we we need to remove the ear speaker and front camera Flex remove the six screws that hold this down again keep these in order because they are all different sizes and and failure to put them in the right place can cause damage to the back of the screen with those six screws removed we can now lift up this shield and put that to one side now I'm going to take out the front camera first and hold that back remove the a speaker just like that and then I'm going to use a low temperature heat setting to soften the adhesive that holds down these sensors on the back of the screen it's got a front microphone ambient light sensor and proximity sensor on there so we just need to get it warm so that we can lift it off easy enough you can use a heat gun or hair dryer to achieve the same effect as this the heat gun is just a little bit more controllable once it's warmed up and the adhesive is softened we're going to go under there with the tweezers to REM release the proximity sensor then I'm going to pry underneath this small bit of flex cable here to release the connectors for the ear speaker and then finally we need to remove the ambient light sensor by getting underneath it with the tweezers just here and lifting upwards to release it once they are all released then we can peel back holding onto this part here and free the whole Flex cable moving down the screen now we're going to remove the home button this is held down by four triwing screws this time remove all four of the screws then use your tweezers again to remove the small Shield all four of these triwing screws are the same size so don't worry about mixing those up but keep them separate from the rest of the screws the easiest way to remove these home buttons is to get your plastic primer tool again or your sper and separate first the flex cable there from the screen connector push that back a little bit and then again with a little bit of heat we're just going to warm it up a little bit so that we can soften the adhesive once it's warmed up I'm just going to get one point of the tweezers and just get underneath that Flex cable just here all the way through to the back of it and then lifting up to release the home button just like that the next step is optional but what we're going to do is copy the screen data from the old screen and paste it onto our new screen obviously not everybody has one of these um screen writing tools and if you don't it's not the end of the world it will mean that the true tone function is no longer available though I'll be using this TX Pro screen it comes with an adhesive seal and the new screen that has got the back plate on there you may have to transfer your back plate depending what screen you buy but I'm not going to show you how to do that on this video because mine's already installed they always have a film on the on the front of these screens so I'm just going to poke that through so that I can thread through the old home button it's really important to keep the old home button in good order because if you damage this home button it will r the touch ID to install the home button you need to thread it through just like that and then flip the screen back over and I'm just going to use the tweezers to realign the FPC connector with the home button this is probably the trickiest part of the repair so take your time to make sure you get this right now that we got this FPC connector the M end in line with the female end we're just going to fold it over with my thumb and I'm going to push it down and make sure it's tight that's connected now so we're going to reinstall the shield and the four triwing screws don't forget if you like repair content just like this make sure you like the video and subscribe to the channel WE Post two times a week we post repair content twice a week and you might just learn something also if you're having a go doing this repair yourself let me know how you get on in the comments below now that that home button's installed it's a good time to just check that it's set flush on the screen and it feels like the original did this one feels good so we're going to flip the screen back over and start working on the top of the screen now peeling off this little bit of film and then we're going to line up the front camera Flex cable there's two little sort of sticky out bits there we're going to line those up with the two sticky the two holes on the a speaker Flex once they're lined up it usually means that the rest of the flex cable will line itself up but if you have any trouble you just want to flip this round and use some fine tweezers to realign the sensors into the small plastic brackets that they sit in that's one in just apply a little bit of pressure and then for the second one that one should line up nicely it's a little bit awkward but once you're in if if you find that it's springing back out just keep your just keep your thumb in place holding it down whil you place on top of it the ear speaker make sure this ear speaker goes the right way you can see where the pins are here they need to line up with the pins on this Flex pop that on there notice how I'm keeping my thumb on it again then I'm going to fold the front camera on keeping my finger on it this time so there's always pressure and it's not springing out and then my finger holds down the bracket what sits on top of it and then just while that's doing that I'm going to get one screw in so that I can release my finger now that that's secured down with one screw we can get the other five screws secured down I'll reiterate the fact that you need to make sure that the right screws go in the right place if for example you put a wrong screw in this one what I'm putting in now you will end up leaving a screw mark on the back of the glass or even worse cracking your new display so make sure they go back in the right order with those six screws now secured we're going to go back to Preparing the chass Whoever has been in this one last didn't replace the adhesive seal which does make it a little bit easier for me to clean up the easiest way that I've found to clean them is by using one of these number 17 xacto blades and we're just going to run the edge of the blade along the edge of the chassis to remove any leftover adhesive and make sure that it's nice and clean so that we can install our new adhesive seal you don't want to go too crazy at this because it is aluminium and using a steel Blade the steel Blade's harder than the aluminum and could leave marks on the shassy once you've removed the excess adhesive I'm going to use a little Corsair cleaning brush and with some acetone or isopropyl alcohol on it and I'm just going to clean up those edges to make sure that they're absolutely spotless if you don't have one of these sort of repair specific brushes like this one you can use a toothbrush as long as it's a clean one to achieve the same effect once that's clean make sure that it's dry before you start applying the new seal and the easiest way to apply that is by lining up the top left hand corner first make sure that it lines up then follow through on this left hand Edge make sure that that lines up nicely with the edge of the chassis and then the rest of it should sit into place nicely once it's lined up take your plastic sper and run it into the edge with the flat end of the spider tool so that it's stuck down nice and secure with that in place now I'm going to pull up on this little tab leaving behind the adhesive seal which you can see on the edges is the little black tape that sits on there we can now begin putting this back together just make sure when you're reconnecting this that the battery is still isolated and start off by reattaching the home button connector first which is the smaller one of the two line that up get that in place and put pressure on it to secure it then the screen connector which is what powers the LCD and touch and then before we do the battery we want to make sure that the front camera is connected too so I use tweezers to help me guide this into place just make sure that you don't put it on upside down I've seen that happen before and then push it down to rescure it just like that this would be a very good point to test your new screen and make sure that touch and all other functionality is working but for the purpose of this video I'll continue reassembling the phone use your tweezers to line up this Shield here and then rescure it with the three cross head screws that hold that down once you've secured those three screws we can move back down the the phone and reconnect the battery now make sure that that's stuck down good because if it isn't the phone won't boot properly and you'll probably get a boot loop problem reinstall the shield that goes on top of those again make sure that you're putting the right screws in the right place you can see this is one of the longer of the the four screws one long one goes here and the other long one goes in this one here it's really important at this point because you can do un irreversible logic board damage if you end up putting a long screw in this one here so just be very mindful of that small screw in this top one and then the other small screw goes into this one here and that's the phone res secured reconnected just a quick glance through the phone to make sure that there's no screws missing from this one and then we're going to close up the screen I always always always reattach the screen at the top then apply pressure along the edges on the bottom of the screen to make sure it sits right and then whilst it's turning on I'm going to reinstall the two penob screws back into the bottom of the device if the phone doesn't turn on straight away don't panic sometimes they have to be connected to a charging cable to boot them after the battery's been disconnected as you can see we've got the Apple logo and it's turning on and now that it turn on we're going to check that the home button works first of all and we get haptic feedback from it and then we're going to check that touch is working all the way through the device that just about completes this guide on how to replace the screen the iPhone SE 2020 thank you for watching and see you next time",

      "transcript": "If your Galaxy S20 Ultra’s screen is cracked,\nor starting to turn green, replacing it yourself is an option and we can show you how! This video will guide you through replacing\nthe display on your Galaxy S20 Ultra! For this repair you will need, an iOpener,\na Suction Handle, a set of iFixit Opening Picks, a Spudger, Tweezers, A Phillips 00\nScrewdriver, and some high concentration isopropyl alcohol. We recommend over 90%! And for parts, you will need a replacement\ndisplay and if not already applied, some adhesive to hold the new display in place. You will also need adhesive for the back cover\nwhen closing your phone. We also recommend using our Magnetic Mat so\nthat you can keep track of screws and write down notes during your repair, And following\nthe guide on ifixit.com. On the guide you can read tips and tricks\nthat will help you throughout the repair. Before you begin make sure that your battery\nis drained to below 25%. This reduces the risk of fire if the battery\nis damaged during the repair. WARNING\nIf your battery is swollen, take appropriate precautions and do not heat your phone. We’ll leave a link with swollen battery\ninstructions in the description below. Start by heating up an iOpener and place it\non the bottom edge of the phone's back cover. Leave it there for about two minutes. Then apply a suction handle on the spot you\njust heated and pull up with a strong steady force. This will create a gap between the cover and\nthe frame for the next step. WARNING\nDo not apply excessive force with the pick while cutting the adhesive during the next\nfew steps, or you might crack the back cover glass. When you see the gap-grab an opening pick\nand insert the point into the gap so that the adhesive doesn’t readhere. This may take more than one attempt due to\ntight tolerances. If so, apply more heat. Once you have your pick inserted-slide the\npick back and forth along the bottom edge making sure you slice through all the adhesive. Leave a pick in the seam so that the adhesive\ndoesn’t reseal. Grab your iOpener again and heat the left\nedge of the back cover this time and insert a pick in the middle of the phone and slide\nit towards the bottom. When you are done cutting all the adhesive\nthere, leave the pick at the bottom edge and then grab another pick and slide it to the\ntop edge. Now repeat the same process on the right edge. Once that is done use your iOpener to heat\nthe top edge and use your pick to slice through the adhesive there. When slicing around the corners at the top\nbe careful because the curved edge is very susceptible to cracking. Be very gentle. Once you have released all the adhesive you\ncan remove the back cover. Now go ahead and use your spudger to disconnect\nthe wireless charging coil connector. Use a pair of tweezers to gently peel the\nwireless charging coil up and away from the phone. Grab your driver and remove the five phillips\nscrews securing the motherboard bracket. Then with your tweezers unclip and remove\nthe bracket. With your spudger disconnect the battery connector,\nand then use your driver to remove 5 more phillips screws securing the loudspeaker and\nlower midframe. Insert your tweezers into the notch at the\ntop left corner of the lower midframe and pry up to release the clips holding it in\nplace. It should come right out. With your spudger go ahead and disconnect\nthe display cable on the motherboard. WARNING\nDo not apply excessive force with the pick while cutting the adhesive during the next\nfew steps, or you risk cracking the display. If your display is cracked, pause here and\nfollow our guide on how to tape over a cracked phone screen, linked in the description below. Tape will keep glass shards in place and provide\nan even surface for the suction handle. Next grab your iOpener and begin heating the\ntop edge of the display for about two minutes. Once it's nice and hot apply a suction handle\nas close to the center of the top edge as possible. Start pulling on the suction handle with a\nstrong and steady force until you see a gap. If you have any trouble be sure to apply a\nhot iOpener again. When you see the gap insert the point of an\nopening pick and then leave it there so the adhesive doesn’t reseal. Get another pick and insert into the same\ngap and slide it across the top left corner. Make sure you slice through the adhesive and\nthen leave the pick in the corner. Now grab another pick and do the same towards\nthe top right. Slide the center pick further into the top\nof the phone making sure you cut the adhesive. You can then remove the pick if you want,\nbut we decided to leave it to make sure the adhesive doesn’t reseal. Get your hot iOpener again and start heating\nthe right edge of the display for a bit, and then insert an opening pick into the gap at\nthe top right corner. Start sliding the pick down towards the bottom-cutting\nall adhesive in your path and leave the pick on the bottom right corner. Then insert a pick in the center to prevent\nthe adhesive from sticking. Repeat this process on the left edge of the\nphone. With all that done we are now going to grab\nsome isopropyl alcohol and apply it behind the display through the bottom of the phone. This will release the clear adhesive under\nthe screen. Tilt the phone around so that the alcohol\nspreads and loosens all the adhesive. If you left the pick in at the top center\nof the phone-remove it now and then grab your spudger and slowly insert the flat end under\nthe screen and separate any remaining adhesive. With all that done you can now remove the\ndisplay Before you install your new display be sure\nto clean all the old adhesive and install new adhesive to your phone. This is important to hold the display in place\nand retain water and dust resistance. We have a video on how to do just that in\nthe description. With your adhesive installed, bring over your\nnew display and insert the display cable through the hole in the case. Then lay your display down but don’t remove\nthe adhesive liner just yet. Flip the phone over and connect the display\ncable and then connect the battery. Now is a good time to power up your phone\nand make sure your new display is working correctly. If it is, go ahead and power off your phone\nfirst-then disconnect the battery and display cables. Remove your display and then remove the adhesive\nlining to expose the glue. Now you can install your display again and\nthen flip the phone over to connect the display cable. Now go ahead and re-install the loudspeaker\nand screw it back into place. You can now safely reconnect the battery. Next lay the motherboard bracket back into\nplace and and re-install the screws securing it to the phone. Grab your wireless charging coil and connect\nit first so that it is properly aligned and then you can press it down into place. Before you close up your phone be sure to\napply new adhesive to your back cover. We have a video that walks you through this\nprocess linked in the description below. Lay the back cover on to your phone and press\nit firmly in place. then be sure to set some weight, like a book\nor a toolkit, flat on top of the phone for at least 30 minutes so that the adhesive seals\ntight.",

      "title": "$80USD Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another Hugh Jeffries video in this video I'll be restoring the Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra Samsung's high-end Galaxy phone from 2020. this one's seen much better days just about every centimeter of this phone is either cracked dented or scratched it also has not one but three of those annoying magnetic Car mounts glued to the back why would anyone need so many I purchased it online for 120 Australian dollars or around 80 USD when plugged in it doesn't line up but it's drawing around 500 milliamps to fix it up I'll of course be needing a new display and rear glass but I've also decided it's worth replacing the original battery while I'm at it I'll begin by first heating what's left of the rear glass on a heat plate before prying It Off while I'd usually use a suction cup and plastic pick to avoid damaging the frame or glass if it were intact for this phone we'll be replacing both so it doesn't matter additionally given just how shattered the glass is a suction cup won't stick lifting up the back panel we get our first look inside the s20 ultra I won't be throwing away the back panel just yet as there's still a microphone attached to it that we'll need to salvage later on first to come out is the wireless charging coil connected with one Flex cable and five Phillips screws one being hidden under the coil itself next is the upper antenna again Samsung has been a bit sneaky and hidden a screw right next to the LED flash with a proper look inside the s20 ultra we can see that it resembles both the layout of Samsung's before and after it the most notable difference is the amount of space taken up by the mini cameras especially the ultra zoom lens once I've disconnected all the flex cables running to the motherboard and unfastened two Phillips screws it can be pulled out of place packed into this multi-layer multi-section motherboard is an exynos 990 with up to 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gigs of storage proceeding with the repair it's time for the lower section of the phone to come apart the speaker which houses a liquid indicator appears to show liquid has entered the phone but I'm not able to find any signs of damage it's possible for these to be tripped by things like humid weather so they're not always accurate just three screws is all it takes to get the USBC charging board out of the phone then using some alcohol I can loosen up the vibration motor and break it free up top we've still got the selfie camera which is glued in place using an X-Acto Knife I'm able to cut through the adhesive and release the camera and with that the s20 ultra has been disassembled compared to some phones this was a walk in the park all the screws we removed are the same type and length making this process almost foolproof getting out the first of the new components it's time we begin getting this phone back in one piece the display like most modern phones is the most expensive part to replace and is why many phones once broken never get repaired many just find it easier to replace the whole phone I'll start by reinstalling the vibration motor and charging port once its screws are attached it's time for two Flex cables the speaker and its appropriate screws foreign it's time to get the front-facing camera reattached I'll then be sure to remove any plastic film before installing the motherboard into the phone now comes time for the new battery the original is in unknown condition and while it would likely work it's several years old and like all batteries with age and use come significant wear if I'm working inside the phone I might as well spend the twenty dollars to replace the battery once it's in I can reattach both charging port cables the new display and finally the battery flipping over the phone it's time for a test sure enough the phone is working but it's got a passcode on it but don't worry we'll wipe it later I can now continue to assemble the phone placing back the plastic antenna piece and the wireless charging coil foreign it's back into position the last thing we need to do is prep the new back glass I'll need to salvage the microphone from the one we removed earlier and place it onto our new back glass there was also a little foam grounding piece which I decided to transfer as well once the phone is free for mini dust I can remove the plastic protective film from the back panel and press it down into place securing it to the frame of the phone foreign I need to wipe the previous owner's data from the phone with the phone connected to a computer I can hold both the power and volume up buttons once into recovery mode I can factory reset the device now the last thing left to do is remove the plastic protective film and we're done so this is it a repaired Galaxy s20 Ultra once badly destroyed it has been repaired to an almost brand new looking State like many of Samsung's flagship phones it was fairly easy to repair with the only real downside being the two hidden screws and the high cost of replacement displays but nevertheless this s20 Ultra is ready to serve its next owner and on that note this has been a huge Everest video

      "transcript": "you're watching the Samsung Galaxy Z flip disassembly go ahead our move this entry first you want to heat up both of the back plates so you can loosen up the adhesive underneath it and then going to use a plastic pry tool to work your way around and gently pry off the backs how does that cover over here covering the connector you're gonna pop that cover off next go ahead and disconnect the cable so here are your two back covers this one is the one with LCD screen so it looks like Samsung also took the same approach with a two battery method they have one battery here a larger one and a smaller rectangular battery right over here you have 14 Phillips screws you need to remove at this point once your screws are removed remove this cover over here and disconnect your battery cable for the bottom battery let's go ahead and lift up his top cover over here they're gonna disconnect your battery cable that's on the top part now this connect your wireless charging pad peel it off here's a closer look at that now we're gonna remove the speaker assembly so here's your speaker assembly now we're going to disconnect the cable for the screen located right here as well as the rest of the cables you have a power button the flex cable connector right over here it's gonna add we're also in this connectors place the cable connectors we should leave from this flip to the other one you have one more cable here and give your cable over here for your piece and top mic right there your main mic is gonna be down here on the bottom you have one throw screw holding on the mainboard and locate it right here Gordan us with that are in this connector front facing camera pop it up now we're gonna remove the mainboard so here's your main board every SIM reader right here your camera assembly right here the two cables are located right there if you want this connect them just pop it off and remove it with this metal frame house bordering it your proximity sensor is located right here and here's other side of the board they're using that board on top of the other board layout so basically you have a smaller board that's sitting on top of the main board you can see right there now we're going to remove the battery on top so here's that battery now we're gonna remove the charger port board down here just kind of the cable here's that board here's your mic the gold piece right there here's other side so there's no rubber gaskets or anything like that to prevent any type of liquid damage or water getting inside the phone or so for the larger battery you're gonna have to apply some heat and then try to make some leverage from the side of the battery so get a pry tool in there time for the membership card so here's a larger battery all right so if you need to replace the power button there's a plastic cover over here you'd have to remove first and for the volume keys the Flex cables here there's a bracket over here just slide it up and it comes out of the frame now for Samsung design on the flip phone they basically made it somewhat of a repairable design as far as most of the components go because you'll be able to remove the back covers of the phone and gain access to the battery or other parts you need to replace however when it comes to the screen that's a whole different story because on this design the screen is actually adhered to the frame so your screen cables right here you have these cables over here which are run through the flip area where the hinge area is to come out on this side and connect to this board over here and the battery over here and so forth but the screen itself there's a small thin border right there you can see it's attached to the frame over here so now we're gonna have to pry that off hoping we don't damage the screen itself all right now we're gonna peel off the plastic border that goes around so basically over here on the middle part of the phone these two latches right here that indent in basically keep them forced to screen and the center where the creases down so it doesn't like fold over like how the razor's does a little bit that he could get underneath it so basically it keeps a flush and down so when you're closing it you can see there right there holds the screen down or once those borders are off you're gonna have to pry this screen off carefully so you don't damage it we're careful on the bottom part over here not the side where the camera is the opposite side the cable is run through the mid frame so be careful you don't tear that just use something then you could get underneath the metal plate of the screen and then you're gonna have to work your way around prying it off an apply he doesn't need it throughout the process already to support one so somewhat easier for me or once we pry the screen off the little bits all the adhesive is loose then you're gonna have to gently slide the screen down and out of the frame so here's a look at the screen same thing like a Razors paper-thin I'm wanting to point out you have magnets all around the corner is now killing off this film over here reveals the hinge mechanism underneath it so you can see the mechanism over here inside as you close and open and there you have it guys now I'm gonna go ahead and reassemble the phone once you got all the screws back in place we connect the cable for the outside screen we're going to put them cover back over and then we're going to put the bottom cover back on we flip it over power it on and you're done thanks again for watching guys I'll see you guys in the next video",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Teardown! - Where is the Glass?!",
      "transcript": "so Samsung ended up responding to the verge regarding my Galaxy Z flip durability test video and it's interesting what they said they said the Galaxy Z flip features an infinity flex display with Samsung ultra-thin glass this first-of-a-kind utg technology is different from other galaxy flagship devices while the display does Bend it should be handled with care also the galaxy Z flip has a protective layer on top of the ultra-thin glass similar to the Galaxy fold that last sentenced they're telling us there is protection on top explains exactly what we saw during the durability test that protective layer was the layer that was getting damaged and the glass is well maybe underneath all that somewhere I never backed down from a good challenge it's time to find some glass let's get started with the bumpers off I noticed something that must have happened between filming of my last video and filming this video while the phone was sitting on my desk strange crack started appearing along that center line of the hinge and they appear to be below the surface of this protective layer my phone has obviously been through quite a bit of stress but this is still pretty strange now some protections are removable you know like a helmet or sunglasses or a screen protector but peeling off this particular protection reveals that it's not meant to be removed or replaced this galaxy Z flip screen protector thing protects the screen in the exact same way your skin protects your internal organs remove it and you'll probably die which is what we see happening here going full mkbhd on this z flip destroys the phone now Samsung has offered a one-time screen replacement for broken screens for $119 after that'll be 499 but it's nice of them to offer that first replacement so cheap I'm not really sure how much we can call it a protective layer though when it's actually essential to the phone's survival it's not really protecting the screen it is the screen so if the screen ever does get scratched at a level 2 with deeper grooves at level 3 the damage is still very perfect let's go find that glass though looks like I accidentally ripped off the ribbon cable connecting this screen to the internals I'll check out the guts here in a second the body of the Z flip is still super impressive though we'll be taking apart that hinge to see the bristles Samsung advertised during their launch event now according to Samsung we should start seeing the glass there right underneath this integral epidermis and ladies and gentlemen I think this is it little shards of cracked glass are covering the OLED layer right underneath that plastic protection shiny little slivers of glass are scraping away with my tweezers almost like little slivers of fiberglass and it glistens just like broken glass does not to mention my fingers are now full of it fair payback I guess well played there is glass in here it's just not the physics bending revolution we all kind of thought it would be now Samsung did say that the top protective layer was similar to what they had on their first Galaxy fold so we'll take a look real quick it looks like both screens have the same hard copper layer glued behind the display probably for rigidity for the parts that aren't supposed to flex pulling off just the top transparent layer of the fold reveals that indeed both phones have a similar top plastic protection but underneath that layer the screens are constructed differently we can see that the fold has clean flexing plastic while the flip has the thin crack layers of glass I imagine the glass layer does help keep the display a tad more rigid than if it didn't exist at all but it's still not what your fingers are touching when you use the phone and it's important to remember that the outer layer of the new flip is still as soft as the original Galaxy fold let's see if we can tear this thing open and find those dust resistant bristles inside the hinge I'll removed your black tape protecting the inner screen side of the hinge this reveals a ton of screws but not a whole lot else at the moment we'll flip the phone around and come in from the other side the top piece of glass comes off easy enough this got crushed during the bin test which the Galaxy Z flipped performed very well in actually I'll disconnect the front screen ribbon like a little Lego remember this is the tiny little display the viewfinder thing that we can see when the phone is closed kind of fun I'll bust out my heat gun for the bottom section of glass since it's still glued into place the heat helps soften the adhesive and I can pull the glass away from the foam body with my suction cup and pry tool setting that off to the side we get our first look at the wireless charging pad in the bottom half of the phone there is one screw holding down the black plastic bracket over top of the ribbon cable once that's unplugged I can set the wireless charger off to the side and I can start on the plastics the bottom black plastics have five screws then that loudspeaker can come away from the foam body you can see the white water damage indicator next to the gold contact pads which let the speaker communicate with the motherboard the top plastics have their own six screws and then an additional two screws at the bottom of the large rectangular plate and I'll be honest this thing actually looks super awesome inside thumbs up for that a transparent skin on this phone would look incredible let me know in the comments if I should bring the clear skin back again with D brand I'll use my plastic pry tool to unplug the top battery you know since we would hate to damage the phone or anything I'll unclip the extension ribbons like little Legos and then the side volume ribbon over here on the left the top motherboard has one screw holding it into the phone and interestingly enough there are several small magnets along the top that I assume help keep the phone shut when it's in the closed position I'll take out the removable SIM card tray unplugged the front-facing camera and then the Zee flip motherboard can pull away from the frame of the phone this thing also looks pretty phenomenal it's got a sheen covering the entire board like a rainbow gotta love that I'll flip the board around and unplug the two main rear cameras we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera on the left with no optical image stabilization and the main 12 megapixel camera on the right with optical image stabilization the front-facing camera seems to be glued into place or could possibly be that I bent the phone too much during the bin test and now it's not gonna come out easy either way it does come out in pieces we can see the colourful sensor on the back here which catches the light and transmits the image to your phone and then we have the lens portion which brings the light into the sensor pretty cool we have the rectangular earpiece speaker the circular vibration motor and the little circular contact pads for the volume rocker along with another little white water damage indicator next to the SIM card tray opening samsung has included two batteries inside the Zi flip the phone feels very well-balanced when the whole thing is assembled this top battery comes out relatively easy and is a 930 milliamp hour capacity down here at the bottom of the phone I can pop off the along extension ribbon cables along with one screen ribbon that's attached to the charging port board this is the same one that I ripped on accident when we were looking for glass on the screen I'll just set it over here the bottom of the phone also has a series of magnets along the edge of the frame to keep things closed the charging port board can pop out of the frame still attached to the extension ribbon of course this little guy has the bottom microphone built-in and the USBC charging port it looks like these long black extension wires run through and are built into the hinge mechanism so it should be interesting to take a look at when I pull all that off but first the battery this one is glued much more securely into the frame and once again Samsung went a bit overkill on the glue but it does eventually come out this one is a much larger 2,370 milliamp hour for a total of thirty three hundred when we add both batteries together now that everything is successfully removed from the phone let's see what this new hinge design has to offer us remember Samsung redesigned this thing with bristles inside to help keep out the dust since dust is a folding phones worst nightmare I'll start with the four black screws here in the center once those are out I can remove both the top and bottom Center trays this shows four large spring looking things but not a whole lot else we got to go deeper Samsung says this hinge is inspired by a lotus blossom and the hideaway hinge allows the phone to be propped open at a tea angle kind of like a laptop I'll remove the eight screws holding the bottom half of the frame to the hinge then I can carefully separate the two halves by pulling the ribbon cables through the bottom by bringing in the frame we might as well go all the way at this point I'll take off the remaining eight screws holding the hinge at the top half of the frame and after removing the rubber stopper from the hinge opening I can pull the extension ribbons through the top half of the frame and our galaxy Z flip hinge is free it looks kind of cool actually the amount of engineering inside this thing is insane it is still attached to the metal samsung logo spine piece but I can separate that easy enough by breaking loose the center black brackets on both sides which then frees up the ribbon cable and exposes the final two screws to disassemble the Z flip hinge and here we are up till this point I haven't seen a single bristle inside this hinge which you know would help keep dust out and if you remember from Samsung's announcement it looked like the bristles were all over the place in here wait no this is hilarious I found them they aren't all along the inside of the hinge they're just over here scrunched over on the edge at the little end caps which I guess is still pretty effective they're marketing just you know made it seem like things would be a little different but that just seems to be the theme in general with the Z flip the actual geared mechanism is here marvel of the mobile era straight-up steampunk inside the phone the Galaxy Z flipped quite possibly is the coolest phone of this year and definitely the most durable folding phone I've ever tested all that being said Samsung is the number one smartphone manufacturer in the world and the hype for this phone was particularly extreme not very well worded I think Samsung needs to tighten up their marketing a bit it's pretty safe to say that the whole world thought this phone was going to have a glass display you know since they literally said on their website meet the first ever folding glass screen on a Galaxy yeah we said folding glass made of Samsung ultra-thin glass it sets you up for an epic view with a smooth flat screen combine that with the bending physics comment it's a little excessive for what we actually got you know and then the bristle thing I feel kind of like we got catfished on tinder this phone still a 10 out of 10 of course but it was claiming to be a 15 and because of that now I feel like it's a 6 if they would have come out and said something like we have created a brand new revolutionary ultra-thin glass substrate that can flex and fold on the new Galaxy SIII flip this optically clear glass core technology will take flexible screens to the next level I think you know phrasing it like that would more accurately portray what's going on while still hyping everyone up for something new the galaxy Z flip isn't actually bending any laws of physics and that's ok it's still a 10 out of 10 and I'd still swipe right let me know what you think down in the comments should Samsung have been more realistic about the whole folding glass thing coming out with me on Instagram and Twitter and thanks a ton for watching I'll see you around",

      "transcript": "this is the samsung galaxy z flip 4 disassembly if you want to see more videos like this make sure you subscribe and follow me on twitter so you'll be notified when i upload a new video if you'd like to further support the channel you can leave me a super thanks below and i'll make sure to reply to all the super thanks comments and if you need any tools there are links in the description first the sim chain needs to be removed next heat needs to be applied to both the top and bottom back plate before we can use a plastic pry tool to pry them off here's a better look at the glass back plate there's a plastic cover covering the connector which needs to be removed once that cover flies off you can disconnect the flex cable from the main board the glass camera lens covers can be replaced by applying heat and gently prying them off there's some graphene foam on the inside to help transfer heat and the outer screen is adhered to the glass plate there are two phillips screws which need to be removed that are holding on the metal plate covering the connectors for the most part internally the z-flip 4 looks very similar to the z-flip 3. however there are differences between the two on the z-flip 4 the battery connector is connected on the motherboard on this side of the board compared to the z-flip 3 where it's connected to the right side of the board another difference i can see on the z-flip 4 there's only a single millimeter 5g antenna on this side compared to the z flip 3 which has dual there's one over here and one over here surprisingly there's still a slot over here in the frame for a second millimeter wave antenna also for the bottom half on the z flip forward the connector is on this side compared to the z flip 3 which is on the other side here's a comparison picture between the two now the film needs to be peeled off we'll start off by disconnecting the battery cable first once that's disconnected we can proceed to disconnect the rest of the cables there are eight more phillips screws on this side of the flip that need to be removed the top plastic cover can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that the front-facing camera cable needs to be disconnected from the main board however that 10-megapixel front-facing camera is glued in place so prying it off would damage or break it at this point the main board can be lifted up and removed this is a dual layer board design there's a 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 12 megapixel wide lens the main camera is the only one with ois or optical image stabilization the led flash is located below and there's a secondary microphone located on the top corner the sim reader is located on the back as well as the camera connectors which can be disconnected by just popping them off there's a proximity sensor and some more graphite film to help transfer heat once that's peeled off we can see thermal paste on top of the ram which sits on top of the processor here's a better look with the thermal paste removed so once that board is removed we can see a 3d layer of graphite underneath the motherboard that again helps transfer heat this flex cable is for the power button and fingerprint reader if you wanted to replace that or remove that you'd have to lift up and pull up this plastic cover and rubber gasket and then it would release the power button and you'd be able to pull it out the flex cable for the volume key is located here and held on with some adhesive if you need to replace that you have to gently pry that cable off and lift up and pull out this plastic and metal bracket to remove the millimeter wave antenna you'd have just lift up and pull out this metal bracket and it will slide out here's a better look at that now when it comes to removing this battery there are no pull tabs to help you pry it off so you will need to use some isopropyl alcohol and apply some to the edges of the battery and let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute so this will have the adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off here's a better look at the 1070 milliamp hour battery the earpiece speaker is located on top and that's also held on with some adhesive there are seven phillips screws on the bottom half which need to be removed the metal cover needs to be removed the battery cable for the bottom half as well as the nfc antenna and wireless charging coil cable need to be disconnected here's a better look at that the bottom speaker assembly can be lifted up and removed this bottom speaker assembly has a little white foam balls which make the speaker sound larger than it actually is this flex cable as well as the one for the screen need to be disconnected from the sub board there's a single phillips screw which is holding down the sub board that needs to be removed now the sub board can be lifted up and removed the flex cable connecting the sub board to the main board needs to be disconnected the charger port and primary microphone are both located on this sub board there's also a red rubber gasket around the charger port itself here's a look at the other side there are also no pull tabs on the bottom battery to help us pry it off so we're gonna have to use some isopropyl alcohol here as well and apply some around the edges of the battery and let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute so it eats with adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off here's a better look at the 2630 milliamp hour battery the vibrator motor is located on the bottom and is held down with some adhesive there are also rubber gaskets and mesh filters over the microphone openings as well as the speaker opening and there's a liquid damage indicator sticker underneath the simulator on the frame these flex cables are round through openings in the frame and there are cure and place rubber gaskets which basically seal up the opening so no water or debris gets through when it comes to replacing the inner foldable screen is pretty much the same as the z-flip 3. if you want to see that in more detail you can watch the video i did on the z-flip 3. i don't want to risk prying this working screen off since there's a high chance of damaging it the folding screen cable is located here and basically all you have to do at this point is to pry off this plastic border and then you'd heat up the foldable screen and just pry it off the frame for the repairability score on this phone i give it a 4 out of 10. now it's time to put this phone back together once everything is back in place flip over the phone power it on and you're done i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll see you in the next one you",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z FLIP 4 Screen Repair | How to Replace",
      "transcript": "this is how you fix the screen on a Samsung Galaxy Z flip 4. let's get right into this all right so here we have the Samsung Galaxy Z flip 4 and as you can see the screen is just totally blacked out if I hit the power button right here you can see that the only part of the screen actually that turns on is that little piece right there you can also hear that the phone is on because you can hear the person in the background talking see we do have this uh LED part on the back side of the phone does actually work all right so let's get into this repair let's look at the screen first so as I pull this out this is a Samsung Service Pack and this is the North American USA version of this now when I mean USA version what you have to look out the USA version has a slot right here for the 5G antenna let's take off this plastic right here and this is the whole screen so you can see the screen protector is already installed on this phone right here here he goes so broken one on the left obviously with the common uh bubbling right here on these folding phones and then here's the new screen right here so this is going to be straight forward you guys this phone may you guys may think that this phone is hard to repair but it's actually just like a normal Samsung phone the only difference is is that it flips right or it folds that's it alright so the first thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna take off these back pieces right here and the way that we're going to do that is with this really thin flimsy tool and poker playing cards right here this thin metal pry tool is so thin that it gets in between the crack right here it'll just slide right in so this OLED screen right here is only about like this big on this Z flip 4. so just keep away from this don't put the card in too deep just kind of just stay like this and go around you're gonna get a heat gun like this all right so as you can see this will come off just like this and we have a popping connection right here so what we'll do is we'll take this off this thing just kind of plucks off right here there we go see this we'll just put this over here somewhere and then we'll just we can just unplug this we can get this out of the way see this piece right here that's the OLED screen right here so when you're taking this back cover off just don't go too far deep in as you can see like that much you see just kind of stay away from it that's it and then this area you're you're far away from it anyways but yeah just kind of just don't put the card in too deep and we're gonna do the same right here there's nothing underneath this part so this part is going to be easy just take this back cover on I'll show you how and as you can see this thing comes off just like this it's just a piece of glass right and on this phone the adhesive actually stayed on there right there so there we go all right so now that the back uh glasses are off of this this is going to be the whole game plan right here you pretty much just take this stuff out and you just transfer it right in here so the first thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to take out a bunch of screws as you can see there's screws all these screws that you see just take them all out right here and kind of organize them too all these screws are all the same size it doesn't matter if you get them mixed up or anything like that all right so as you can see the screws are all taken out now we can take off this you're gonna run into this piece of tape right here so just peel off this tape it's all it's doing is just covering the connections that are in there as you can see we'll just take this we'll just put it on this metal shield because that's where it's actually under right all right then then we can pull these plastic pieces up right here this thing will just come out just like this we can just start unplugging these connections there's that 5G antenna that I'm talking about right here all right so let's take out the screws on the bottom section of this now so you can get a better look of this whole phone all right so we have all the screws taken off and there's actually one single black screw and it seems to be a little bit longer than the rest and it went right there so let's take off this plastic piece in this uh fast uh this is the wireless charging Flex right here all right so this is the this looks like it's the loudspeaker right here put it right here now you can get a better look into the cell phone right here as you see this phone has two batteries right here 's a charging port battery another battery motherboard 5G antenna now let's just start transferring let's start from the top area first we'll unplug the uh front selfie camera oh and take this Sim Trail I forgot to do that poke that in there take this out put it over there now the motherboard will come out you just find a spot to kind of pluck it out right there there it is take that out let's take out the battery so what you're going to want to do is drip a little bit of alcohol underneath the battery you don't need to heat up the battery or anything like that the adhesive on this phone is actually a lot easier to remove than it is on regular Samsung phones for some reason this battery is not even hard to plug out so what I do is I just drip a little bit of 91 alcohol right here you can use stronger 100 percent but I use just the 91 so just get that in there and you just get your tool like this and this thing will just plop out like this now let's concentrate down here on this part make sure that this thing is unplugged right here and then also take out unplug this unplug this right here and we're going to transfer the charging port area let me take out this one screw right here and then as you can see there's actually a popping connection right here right there it plugs in underneath so put this over right here and as you can see this new screen comes with all these new wires so what we're going to do now is take out the battery once again we're going to drip some alcohol in between the crack right here it'll loosen up the adhesive and once again you don't need to use heat underneath or anything like that this adhesive actually on this phone is not even that strong and this thing will just come out just like this and then the battery will come out all right so the only thing that we have left in this phone is the front selfie camera right here we'll leave that in for right now but let's just start transferring the bottom area that we took out from here and let's just transfer it back into here right and if for whatever reason your screen doesn't come with this uh the vibration motor just transfer it over to here but this screen already comes with the with the new vibration motor all right so we're gonna put the um battery in first this goes this way get this thing out of the way so it'll go in then we can put the charging port in actually we have to so this thing goes like this this antenna this cable right here plugs into the bottom of the charging port so it goes right there see that connection all right so now it's connected right here see plugged in then we can put in the charging port can flip this phone around like this and then we can fit it in there like that this phone has a bunch of magnets around here so it's going to be maybe a little bit hard to harder to work with and putting things back then a normal Samsung phone because of the magnets are pulling on your uh Parts some of them and then we'll just plug that in right here and then we can just plug this in right here and then we have the battery that goes in right here let's take out this plastic piece right here this new screen already comes with a ear speaker right here so we can go ahead and plug this stuff in right here plug that in we can put this thing back in right here make sure everything's connected this thing is connected this thing's connected all right so we have everything connected in right here we're going to take our screw we're going to take our single screw that we have here that went into the charging port area right here and it went right here now we can put this plastic piece back in all right so we're gonna put our screws in all right let's plug this in let's plug this in and then we're gonna have the shield right here that's going to cover the battery connection and then put the two screws in all right so the bottom half of the phone is done now let's just concentrate on the top half of the phone so we what we can do is we still have to transfer the front selfie camera and this thing is kind of glued in with some type of silicone as you see so what I do to get this out is I use a pair of tweezers right here and I just kind of break through the side piece right here so you can see let's see if I can get this close enough do not do your best not to poke into the camera because you don't want to poke it and then break it right thank you all right so I actually have the front selfie camera out so everything that we have on the screen is now taken out we don't need this whole front half of the phone anymore so let's just put this aside now let's just focus on just putting this stuff right back in here so we'll start off first with the battery you can just put this in here then we can start off with the motherboard put that back in here and then we can just start plugging all these Connections in actually the 5G antenna that goes right here in the slot right here and now let's just connect all these in right real quick plug that in plug this in plug that in plug this in plug in the power button plug in the battery is fine uh we can put the front selfie camera in then we can put the metal shield back in right here with this tape thing just put it right here put this in I want to tell you guys something very important the very first time I fixed this phone you kind of want to see like it does the screen work and if you hit the power button and you don't have these screws screwed in the screen when it boots up it'll go blank so there's some sensor that's underneath the motherboard knows that the screws are not screwed in and then there because the sensor will think that the phone is like folded or something like that and the screen will just it'll just blank out it'll just be an all black screen all right so then we'll put this plastic piece back in right here put these remaining screws in to put the SIM tray in right here all right so the only thing we have left is to put these back glasses on and plug this in here's some adhesive to put the back glasses on the Z flip four so yeah this is what it looks like you put this in the inside of the back glass and then you can just put it on to the back of the phone let's turn the phone on and that everybody is the Samsung Galaxy Z flip 4th generation screen replacement if any of you guys are interested in starting a small business repairing people's cell phones repairing iPads reselling refurbished unlocked phones reselling accessories like phone cases and all that I do have a cell phone repair course Link in description if you want to check that out thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys on the next repair peace foreign",

      "title": "Motorola Razr Folding Display Replacement - This Phone Got A 1/10 Repairability Score",
      "transcript": "Motorola's first foldable is now over three years old it still feels like affordables are a thing that just came out this Motorola razer's folding display has a purple line running the full length of the screen and while it still works it's distracting this phone's ease of repairability was rated seven times worse than the iPhone 14 on ifixit's repairability score even for a foldable that's still hard to imagine for anyone who's watched my iPhone tear down and repair assessment videos so I'm going to have to enter with an open mind to judge it for myself this will be the second Motorola foldable I've worked on the first being Mr Mobile's newer model Razer 5G which had a broken outer screen I purchased this one from the United States for 65 US Dollars including shipping that's a lot less than the thousand dollar price tag this phone had just over three years ago to fix it we're going to need help from this video's sponsor iFixit to celebrate 20 years in business iFixit is doing an anniversary flash sale get a free Monaro toolkit when you spend over 150 US Dollars and use the code bday tools at checkout iFixit also supplied the replacement genuine Motorola parts for this phone including the new foldable screen and its matching adhesive unlike Samsung's foldable screens this one comes with outer frame meaning we need to glue it onto the old one hopefully a task less daunting than it currently seems I believe the current screen's point of failure isn't where it folds but its Flex cable located at the very bottom of the OLED as pressing in this area causes more lines to appear with that it's time we open the phone it's over to the heat plate for several minutes where I can heat the lower section of the device my usual method of using a suction cup to lift up the back panel won't work on this device because of its textured back panel instead I work my plastic pick in without it loosening the adhesive around the top section before flipping it over to the other side there is a small amount of adhesive located at the bottom because of the fingerprint cable we have to gently work the adhesive free to avoid damaging the attached cable this is one of the criticisms of this device in ifixit's tear down this setup reminds me of Apple's iPhone 5s and SE what's different on this phone is that the sensor can be freed without unplugging it it's only attached to the rear panel with white adhesive so I was able to push it free with such a recessed connector I can understand the criticism but I don't think unplugging it at this stage was the intended way of disassembly but now that we have access to the internals we can see one of its two batteries we won't get a chance to see the other as performing an inner display replacement on this phone doesn't require the removal of the outer screen or any components from the top section eliminating the chance of damaging the outer screen trying to remove it if you ask me that's good design next to come out is the speaker which has its own cable hidden beneath along with a plastic retaining bracket and the connections for the antenna and Battery before applying any alcohol I came to the realization that Not only was the other battery still attached but this battery has been stuck down to the motherboard to avoid any possibility of liquid damage I avoided softening the adhesive with alcohol and just went about prying it free using one of ifixit's plastic cards thankfully there was nothing below but can needs to be taken to avoid damaging any service Mount components surrounding the battery all of the connectors on the motherboard are surrounded by a goo likely to keep any minimal liquid entry away from these connectors after unfastening four Torx screws I discovered the board was still attached it was on the other side that I noticed a microphone cable that needs to be unplugged to gain access to it the vibration motor needs to be removed now the motherboard can be folded upwards so that the three remaining cables can be detached this motherboard is packing a Snapdragon 710 processor 128 gigs of storage and 6 gigs of RAM with it free we can see the USBC Port is soldered onto the board preventing an easy replacement we can also see how the display shifts when opened with the fragile Flex cable wrapping around the bottom of the assembly I can see how some Ingress of dirt could possibly damage this cable I believe this is why our OLED display has become damaged the next piece to come out is this metal retaining bracket at the bottom of the phone with that the display is almost free there's just one Flex cable to detach and then we can start working on removing the top section of the display for this it's back to the heat plate for a quick heat before we start prying off the display I found the best point of entry was from the center after folding the phone slightly from here I can insert a plastic prying tool and use some alcohol to help aid the display's removal it'll be interesting to see whether the display still works after it's been pried from the phone we'll test that later on with the top section under here the screen can now be simply slid out from the frame this gives us the opportunity to see the display's hinge mechanism there's been quite a bit of a wear to the back of the old screen as well as quite a bit of dusting grass over the hinge as for the damage to the display I wanted to see if I could spot anything to the cable there's quite a lot of dust but no obvious damage it appears the actual cable is under this yellow tape so it's really hard to tell it's now time for the new display this one has come for Motorola via iFixit iFixit cells select genuine Motorola Parts on their store unfortunately while they Source this one for me it isn't currently listed on their site therefore I have no idea what it cost and I don't have a link for anyone looking to purchase one I'm sure if there was demand they would sell them but this is a repair I don't think they believe most people will tackle I'll remove as much of the old glue residue before applying the new adhesive there is two sides to this I placed the dotted side down against the frame leaving the clearer side of the adhesive upright now comes the most daunting part attaching the folding display I'll slide it into the frame first and attach the metal stopper at the bottom of the phone this stopper prevents the display from pushing out the bottom failure to install this before folding the device shut will cause the new display to fold incorrectly and that could cause damage but the hardest part will be aligning the display as it's spring-loaded we need to pull the display taut but with adhesive this means we only get one shot at it after removing the protective film from the adhesive I slightly folded the display allowing for the new screen to line up with the top of the frame I wasn't quite ready when it took grip this adhesive is incredibly strong and there was no separating it now with it attached it's time for a fold thankfully it worked and didn't snap in half so now it's time we get this phone reassembled for a test it's time for the motherboard to go back in being sure to correctly route the display cable so that it can attach to the top side of the board we of course can't forget to connect the microphone and vibration motor back into place at this point I can partially Slide the speaker under the fingerprint Hardware as it needs to be plugged in from the other side before it's screwed into place once I get the antenna plugged in I'll now take the time to test the display we removed earlier the reason for this is that I'm curious to see if it still works a damaged display that functions for the most part can still be useful for data recovery this one works as well as it did when I removed it so I can keep it or sell it cheaply to someone who needs a test display for now though we'll shut down the phone disconnect our old screen and attach our new one for the battery I'll be reusing the old adhesive as it'll be plenty strong enough to hold it in place with it and its plastic bracket in place it's time we test a new screen after pressing the power button nothing immediately happens but like always with the Razer the inner display takes a little longer to light up once the phone's booted up we can see the display is working perfectly and folds just how it should with that we can power down the phone and install the rear panel but before I do so I'll need to remove all the old adhesive and apply some new stuff I didn't have any genuine adhesive to use here so I just cut some myself this phone is not dust or water resistant so the adhesive is only to hold the back panel in place proceeding I can remove all the protective film from the adhesive before attaching the back panel I'll do this from the front where I can tuck the fingerprint sensor in before positioning the panel flipping the phone over to the back I can now press it into place the last thing left to do is unfold our main display and remove its plastic protective film and we're done so this is it the Motorola Razor repaired and back to fully working order it was certainly a daunting process having to align the fragile folding OLED display on the frame especially since you only have one chance to do it still I think it's worthy of a repairability score greater than one possibly three or four largely due to the soldered on USBC Port having to open both halves for a proper battery replacement and that daunting screen replacement one massive downside to this phone over newer models is its esim only Apple was not the first to remove the SIM card slot as this phone was purchased from Verizon in the US I'm not sure if it's carrier locked but I know physical Sim Verizon phones are not so hopefully the same goes for esim models but I don't have an e-sim to test it also seems Motorola has already forgotten about this phone giving its running Android 11 with a security patch update from January of 2022 more than a year and a half ago and on that note this has been a huge

      "title": "Repairing MrMobile&#39;s Busted Motorola Razr 5G - Feat. Michael Fisher",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge jefferies video in this video we're going to be fixing a totaled motorola razer 5g but not just any razer this one belongs to michael fisher or as he's also known mr mobile only 40 days old at the time this phone sustained some serious damage to the outer display and a small crack to the lower class panel despite the phone being dropped while open the inner folding display is unscathed from any damage to recap how this damage occurred and the issues michael faced with trying to get his phone repaired let's revisit the mr mobile video literally it just falls out of my hand for no discernible reason other than maybe my hand is cold crashes to the sidewalk in a horrible murder scene in fact it was so brutal that the barista here gave me a coffee on the house because she felt bad so knowing i'd have to pay for a repair i started making phone calls and from the big corporate chains like you break i fix to the independent shops in brooklyn nobody offered repair on the new razer if you guys don't repair the razer 2020 right no dice okay with local independent repair shops out of the question michael turned to the phone maker itself motorola he was told this damage is a device replacement not repair which would cost him 965 us dollars which is almost the price of a new razer out of options i reached out to help a few weeks later his razor showed up at my post office box here in australia having been sent all the way from brooklyn in the us with the help of ifixit i think we can get this phone back up and running as you can see the razer has arrived just as damaged as he sent it out also inside the parcel was a note from the man himself which reads hugh thanks in advance for bringing my baby back michael as mentioned in michael's original video the inner display panel works flawlessly however that outer display well it doesn't work at all i'd like to thank ifixit for sponsoring this video get genuine motorola parts to fix your phone at ifixit.com hugh jeffries whilst purchasing replacement parts from ifixit's website is easy they didn't have any parts in stock for this particular phone after getting in touch they managed to source out a replacement outer display for this racer directly from motorola thanks to a partnership they have with them so whilst motorola didn't offer repair for the damage to michael's phone they did however sell us the parts but it wasn't without issue for the rear panel motorola stated the part had reached the end of life and wasn't being sold which is crazy for the latest flagship i feel as though they were confused on what razer phone we were actually talking about in the end i sourced out that part from another place online whilst the experience sourcing parts from motorola wasn't flawless i want to congratulate them on actually selling at least some of their replacement parts to suppliers almost no companies do this it means i can be confident the outcome of this repair will be as good as it can be and i'm not going to have to worry about low quality parts with bad displays or weak glass with our parts ready to go it's time to begin work this phone is glued shut so we'll need to soften that adhesive to do this i can switch on my heat plate at 80 degrees and place the phone on top for a few minutes afterwards we can use a suction cup to apply enough upward pressure to create a gap between the glass and frame next using a plastic pick we can work around the perimeter of the glass panel to separate it from the adhesive this was much easier than i anticipated as it lacks any form of water resistance the adhesive is much weaker once we've made it all the way around the edges you'll notice that the back is now lifting up and away from the phone pulling it off completely you can see we've got our first look inside the motorola razor i'll need to remove two torx screws and this plastic bracket to be able to access one of the battery connections which i will disconnect now that we're inside the motor roller you can see just how it looks in the bottom half there is a battery a fingerprint reader among a few other components it's now time to turn to the top half of the razer where we can remove the obliterated quick view display once again i heated the phone this time being the top section its removal is similar to the back however it's held in with extra glue on top of that there's a microphone cable you need to look out for as well as the two display cables that are attaching to the phone's motherboard and as this display is very shattered it makes its removal more difficult after some careful prying the display can be lifted up and folded to one side so that we can disconnect those previously mentioned display cables after they've been unplugged we can remove any remaining glass left behind by that old screen on that old screen is the camera bracket and led flash which we'll need to take out and save for later as it will need to be attached to the new display panel now we've disassembled this phone as far as we need to we've got access to both the top and bottom sections of this phone one thing that struck my eye was the gap on either side of that folding display this would easily allow dust to enter the phone or get caught up in the display proceeding i'll need to clean up the frame and remove any of the residual adhesive that i can we need to ensure there's no remaining glass or big chunks of adhesive left behind so our new display panel will sit nice and flush in the phone i'll test fit our new display panel to make sure not only it is working but the previous non-functioning display issue wasn't relating to a deeper issue inside the phone with the new screen fitted you can see that it is indeed working just fine i can power down the razor once again and disconnect the display we'll need to apply the adhesive before we can get it fully attached the microphones in this phone are covered by a small mesh sticker that sometimes will come up with the rear or front panel it's vital to remove them and reattach them back into the phone as i'm doing here next to that microphone is a bit of tape which we'll need to pull up and replace i did initially think that was attached to the new adhesive but it wasn't so i'll need to apply some of my own this is better than leaving the old adhesive as after it's lost its grip it can create an annoying clacking sound whenever the new glass is pressed on it's now time to fit the new adhesive going around the perimeter of the bottom section of this phone it is slightly shorter than the edges so there is a slight gap all the way around but this is how it is supposed to be we'll need to repeat the same process for the top section first reinstalling that camera and led flash before applying the adhesive it's important to make sure this is lined up correctly so none of the adhesive is preventing the display from sitting flush i'll need to press it down with my finger and a spudger to ensure that it is correctly seated into position and adhered to the frame after that is done it's finally time to attach that new screen first peeling off the protective film on the camera hole and cable we can attach the first cable to the motherboard thankfully the adhesive is designed in such a way that the display can be connected without the protective film first having to be removed which simplifies the installation process and prevents you from accidentally attaching the display with that second cable plugged in we can do a final test on the phone just to make sure everything is working for mr mobile and once that is all done we can reattach that second battery and fasten its retaining piece of plastic while i always recommend disconnecting the battery before working on anything that's not possible with this phone as the other battery in the top half was still providing power so it's not always possible but this didn't harm the phone next the protective film from the adhesive can be taken off and the display can be pressed down into place ensuring all sides are correctly lined up with the edges of the phone around back we'll need to do the exact same procedure first removing all of the protective film and then applying the new back panel into place as an added measure i used lacquer bands to keep pressure on the adhesive overnight to ensure it didn't break free in the morning i could remove these lacquer bands and see our finished result and finally the last thing we have to do is remove the plastic protective film and we're done so this is it michael fisher's motorola razer 5g after not even motorola offered a repair option we have saved this phone preventing it from becoming e-waste and essentially bringing it back to life i am disappointed that motorola didn't offer a repair option for the outer display or back glass even though they offer repair for the main folding display i hope to see motorola make a change to their offered repairs to include this one with the razer looking sharp there's only one thing left to do send it back to mr mobile i'll wrap the phone in bubble wrap and ship it back in the same box i received it all the way back to brooklyn in the us all right hugh see what we got here you haven't you even returned my newspaper wrapping material thanks hugh oh this is a special moment gosh i forgot how no don't scratch it the first thing you do all right i forgot how much i missed this colorway i've been using the razor but not in the color way i wanted in 2004 that i finally got back and then promptly ruined wow that's gorgeous wow that is gorgeous all over again hello friends michael fisher professional phone dropper here aka mr mobile when i dropped and shattered my motorola razer 5g i was of two minds about it on the one hand from a professional standpoint it was kind of interesting that the one thing everyone worries about on foldable phones the folding display was fine and everything else was shattered but from a personal standpoint of course i was heartbroken this is the phone i wanted in 2004 obviously the earlier incarnation but more specifically i wanted it in this colorway and when i was finally able to buy it with my own money i i was it was the fulfillment of a long-standing nerd dream and it really ruined my whole day week month when i broke it so i'm very thankful to hugh thank you i fix it everyone for helping repair this thing even if it is a shame i had to send it halfway around the world and know someone and have people willing to do me favors to get that repair completed obviously it is still early days for foldables and i would hope that as time goes on this repair process for ordinary consumers gets a little bit easier and with that the razer is back in the hands of mr mobile i'd like to thank michael for sending his phone across as this video wouldn't be possible without him and i'm also really happy to see him enjoying his phone once again and on that note this has been a huge jeffries video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration

      "summary": "The motorola razer 5g sustained some serious damage to the outer display and a small crack to the lower class panel. Despite the phone being dropped while open the inner folding display is unscathed from any damage. The razer 2020 is damaged and out of options. Motorola told the owner it was a device replacement not repair which would cost him 965 us dollars. With the help of ifixit we can get this phone back up and running. Replacement parts from ifixit's website is easy. motorola didn't offer repair for the damage to michael's phone they did however sell us the parts. The rear panel motorola stated the part had reached the end of life and wasn't being sold. parts with bad displays or weak glass with our parts ready to go it's time to begin work this phone is glued shut so we'll need to soften that adhesive to do this i can switch on my heat plate at 80 degrees and place the phone on top for a few minutes afterwards we can use a suction cup to apply enough upward pressure to create a gap between the glass and frame. i heated up the phone to remove the obliterated quick view display once again i heated the phone this time being the top section its removal is similar to the back however it's held in with extra glue on top of that there's a microphone cable you need to look out for as well as the two display cables. sections of this phone one thing that struck my eye was the gap on either side of that folding display this would easily allow dust to enter the phone or get caught up in the display proceeding i'll need to clean up the frame and remove any of the residual adhesive that i can we need to ensure there's no remaining glass or big chunks of adhesive left behind so our new display panel will sit nice and flush in the phone. i'll test fit our new Display panel to make sure not only it is working but the previous non-functioning display issue wasn't relating to a deeper issue inside the phone with the new screen fitted it is indeed working just fine. microphone is a bit of tape which we'll need to pull up and replace i did initially think that was attached to the new adhesive but it wasn't so i will need to apply some of my own this is better than leaving the old adhesive as after it's lost its grip it can create an annoying clacking sound whenever the new glass is pressed on. protective film on the camera hole and cable we can attach the first cable to the motherboard thankfully the adhesive is designed in such a way that the display can be connected without the protective film first having to be removed.

      "transcript": "in this video I'll be taking apart the Motorola Razer 2023 also known as the Motorola Razer 40 if you're interested in seeing more videos like this make sure you subscribe and click on the notification Bell so you'll be notified once I upload a new video and if you need any tools there are links in the description to start off the sim tray needs to be removed here's a look at the SIM tray at this point heat needs to be applied to the back plate and the top flip cover to loosen up the adhesive underneath and then a pry tool can be used to pry them off here's a closer look at the vegan leather covers there's also some graphite film underneath top transfer heat this this is the bottom cover there are now 14 philli screws which need to be removed and some of the screws are different sizes so make sure to label them or organize them correctly so you won't have a problem when reassembling the device this metal cover over the battery connector needs to be removed and there's some adhesive or glue underneath it which you need to carefully separate from this Flex cable now the battery and wireless charging and NFC cable can be disconnected now I'm not sure what sensor this is it might might be the sensor to detect if the flip has been closed but I'm not 100% sure looking at the subboard we can see rber gask around this connector as well as the charger port and the primary microphones located underneath the shield on the other side we can see a liquid damage indicator sticker which is that white sticker here's a look at the bottom speaker assembly and there's some graphi film over it top transfer heat the vibrator or haptic feedback motor is located on the bottom corner and it's held down with some adhesive moving on to the battery in order to remove that there are no pull Taps provided to help you pry it off so you will need to use some isopropyl alcohol app apply to the size of the battery and let us sit for about 30 seconds to a minute so it eat way at the adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off here's a look at the larger battery and keep in mind there are two batteries in this phone and the capacity for this one is 2,965 Milah hour for here's a better look at the external display there are now seven more filp screws which need to be removed the cover can now be lifted over but be careful since the flex cable is still attached underneath this LED flash and laser focus and IB light sensors here's a look at the other side there's some more graph film over the motherboard as well as the battery to help transfer heat which can now be peeled off the battery cable for the battery on the top flip can now be disconnected followed by the rest of the cables there's a 64 megapix primary camera and a 13 megap ultrawide the main camera has y or Optical image stabilization there's a secondary microphone on the top and another liquid damage indicator sticker which that white sticker there are also rber gaskets around these connectors looking at the other side we can see the 32 map front- facing camera as well as the connectors for the other cameras which can be disconnected by just popping them off there's a proximity sensor located here the simor below that and more graphite film on the back Shield top transfer heat once the copper tape and graphite film have been peeled back we can see a metal plate on top of the processor and RAM and here's a look with the metal plates removed the metal plates are5 mm thick to pry off and remove the top battery there are also no pull Taps for this so we're going to have to also use some isole alcohol on this battery the capacity for this battery is 1,235 milliamp hours this Flex cable connects the main board to the subboard as well as the wireless charging coil and N FC antenna and the flex cable is rotted through the flip from the top half to the bottom and there's a cure in place gasket on either side holding it in place if you had to replace that you'd also have to disassemble the flip and use a razor blade or an X-Acto Knife to cut out the gaskets so you'd be able to remove the flex cables the power button and fingerprint sensor is also held in place with a cure and place gasket so again to remove that you'd have to use a razor blade or an exacto knife to cut off the gasket and then pull out the button as for the volume keys the flex cable is routed to the mid midf frame so you would actually have to pry out the main screen or the folding screen to gain access to that Flex cable and the earpiece speaker is located on top which also held down with some adhesive there's one more liquid damage indicator sticker which that y sticker on the frame the cable over here is for the folding screen so if you need to replace that once you have the bottom portion disassembled and flex cable disconnected you would heat up the front portion of the phone to loosen up the adhesive underneath You' pry off the plastic border and then you would have to apply more heat and pry off the folding screen from the frame now I'm not going to pry it off since it's a working screen and there's a high chance of damaging it when prying it off for the repairability score on this phone I give it a six out of 10 now it's time to put the phone back together once everything's back in place apply new adhesive and reapply the covers flip over the phone Power it on and you're done thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video",

      "title": "Motorola Razr Teardown - One of the Most Complex Phones Ever",
      "transcript": "Before we got fancy touchscreen displays,\nfoldable phones were all the rage. And while big touchscreens are great for browsing\nthe web and playing Goat Simulator, you really shouldn’t fold them. Like, really. Now, there’s the Moto Razr. It’s a phone… with a touchscreen… that\nfolds. Now, I know what you’re thinking—didn’t\nSamsung try this already, with the Galaxy Fold? They did, and it was not great.Something tells\nus the Razr is different. This new version uses the same flexible OLED\ntech as the Galaxy Fold—but unlike Samsung, Moto made a phone that actually fits in your\npocket. If you’re a human and you wear pants, maybe\nthis is a phone you could actually use. Here’s the thing though—pulling it in\nand out of your pocket is a lot easier than pulling it apart, but that’s what we’re\nhere to do. So lets get started. Some heat and an opening pick separates the\nback panel allowing us to slide it down. But, Before it comes all the way off, we’re\nforced to reckon with a sneakily placed fingerprint sensor cable. Hidden cables like this are frequent casualties\nduring repairs. Since the lower case of the Razr needs to\nslide away from the device, if you miss that sneaky cable you’re gonna have a bad day. The outer display comes off next, and it’s\na lot more stubborn than the lower case was. But, eventually, more heat and careful prying\nwins the day. This little 2.7 inch OLED display comes with\na minor flex cable booby trap, but we got it off intact, which is more than we could\nsay for the outer display on the Galaxy Fold we tore down last year. Sliding the antenna assembly away from the\nphone we’re once again greeted with a hidden, delicate cable that needs to be disconnected\nbefore the assembly comes all the way off. Seems like booby traps are becoming a theme\nwith this phone. We’ve got one of the Razr’s two batteries\nin our sights, and after drowning it in isopropyl alcohol we’re able to pry it out of the\nphone. This first battery has a typical capacity\nof 1245 mAh. This may be a small battery but it only represents\nabout half of the Razr’s total power reserve, there is still a second battery hidden in\nthere somewhere. Before we get to that, we’ve got a motherboard\nto take out and it’s held in place by T3 torx screws. In fact, all of the screws in this Razr have\nbeen t3 torx. We love seeing manufacturers use a single\nscrew type in a device as it simplifies disassembly and repair. All the cables connected to the motherboard\nare coated in, well… goo. This goo is likely part of the Razr’s splash\nresistance strategy. It’s probably hydrophobic, like dielectric\ngrease, to keep liquids away from sensitive cable connectors. This the only water-resistance measure we\ncould identify. For 1500 dollars you might be getting a very\ncool device but you’re not getting top of the line specs for your money, the Razr sports\na middle of the road Snapdragon 710 and 6Gb of RAM. Getting to the cameras requires removing several\nscrews that secure a mid-frame and some careful board flipping acrobatics to disconnect the\nsecond battery. This is just another example of the Razr’s\ncomplexity making for awkward repairs. Finally, we remove a board that is home to\nboth the 5 Megapixel selfie cam, and the 16 Megapixel rear facing camera. Several more screws and a bracket that’s\nglued and clipped AND magneted hold the Razr’s folding FlexView display in place. The display slides out with the secondary\nbattery hitching a ride. With all the difficulty in getting this sucker\nout it amazes us that Motorola is offering screen replacements for only 299 dollars—less\nthan an iPhone 11 Pro Max. Oh yeah and that secondary battery, it’s\nglued in place in a well on the underside of the display. The idea of prying a battery out against a\ndelicate OLED display is not our idea of fun. This battery is rated at 1265 mAh bringing\nthe total battery capacity of the Razr to 2510 mAh, which is fairly low compared to\nother flagship phones. With the display out of the way, we’re left\nwith the Razr’s bare frame and we can see how the hinge works with its support plates\nto accomplish the folding magic.The folding act of this Razr comprises a continuous geared\nhinge, a cat-head cam, two support plates, and a few springs. Motorola's patents illustrate the way the\ncam and the support plates work together to protect the fragile OLED display. They provide support and hold it taut while\nthe phone is open, then allow room for a generously loose fold (which helps to prevent a crease\nin the display from forming) when it shuts. To Motorola’s credit, all this disassembly\nwas nondestructive—but, repairing this contraption is not for the faint of heart. The Razr might be the most complicated phone\nwe’ve torn down yet, and for that reason it scores a 1 out of 10 on our repairability\nscale. From stubborn brackets to awkwardly layered\nboards and perhaps the most intense battery replacement procedure yet, you’ll have your\nwork cut out for you.

      "summary": "The Moto Razr is a phone with a touchscreen that folds. It uses the same flexible OLED tech as the Galaxy Fold. Unlike Samsung, Moto made a phone that actually fits in your pocket. Hidden cables like this are frequent casualties during repairs. Since the lower case of the Razr needs to slide away from the device, if you miss that sneaky cable you’re gonna have a bad day. The outer display comes off next, and it’s a lot more stubborn than the lower cases was. But, eventually, more heat and careful prying wins the day. About half of the Razr’s total power reserve, there is still a second battery hidden in there somewhere. All the cables connected to the motherboard are coated in, well… goo. This goo is likely hydrophobic, like dielectric grease, to keep liquids away from sensitive cable connectors. The Razr folding display slides out with the secondary battery hitching a ride. With all the difficulty in getting this sucker out it amazes us that Motorola is offering screen replacements for only 299 dollars. The Razr is the most complicated phone we've torn down yet. Repairing this contraption is not for the faint of heart. But it's cool to see what's possible.",

      "transcript": "the screen on the iphone 11 may have been strengthened through a dual ion exchange process but it's not indestructible drops can cause cracked and shattered screens but replacing the screen in your iphone 11 is actually pretty easy and you don't need to rely on apple to do it for you for this repair you'll need an eye opener a set of ifixit opening picks a suction handle or ice clack a spudger tweezers and the following screwdriver bits a p tube pentalobe bit a y triple zero bit and a phillips triple zero bit warning opening the iphone's display will compromise its waterproof seals have replacement seals ready before you proceed past this step or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your iphone without replacing the seals before you begin your repair discharge your battery to below 25 a charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and or explode if you accidentally damage it while you're doing this repair power off your phone and then remove the two p2 pentalobe screws at the bottom edge of the phone near the charging port the iphone's display is secured with some adhesive to soften the adhesive you need to place a heated eye opener on the bottom edge of the phone and leave it there for about a minute if you have a cracked display suction cups might have a hard time attaching to the glass if you're having trouble getting them to stick cover the display with a piece of clear packing tape if you have an ice clack on hand the next step will be easy but if you only have an ifixit suction handle follow the opening procedure on the guide at ifixit.com position the cups of the ice clock near the bottom edge of the iphone one on the front and one on the back and then press the cups firmly into place making sure the suction engages hold on to your iphone securely and close the handles of the ice clock so it slightly separates the screen from the rear case of your phone but be careful don't try and separate the whole thing we're only trying to make a gap for the next step when you see a small gap appear insert an opening pick into the gap under the display to make sure the adhesive doesn't read here once inserted slide the opening pick around the lower left corner and up the left edge of the iphone make sure you slice through all the adhesive holding the display in place just be careful not to insert the pick too far you could damage the internals and you don't want to make this a two-part repair to you take your pick and insert it again at the bottom edge but this time you guessed it slide it up the right side of the phone to continue separating the adhesive the top edge of the display is held on with both adhesive and clips so gently pull the right side of the display down slightly towards the lightning port and insert your pick in the top right corner while gently pulling down slide the pick across the top edge of the iphone and cut all the adhesive in the way now all the adhesives should be separated you can open the iphone up by swinging the display up from the left side kinda like the back cover of the book just be careful and don't try and lift it all the way off it's still attached to the phone via ribbon cables next grab something for you to prop up the display like an old iphone box and if you want you can even use a rubber band to hold it there you'll need your y triple zero bit to remove the three screws securing the battery connector in place and then use some tweezers to remove the bracket from the iphone with the pointy tip of your spudger or a clean fingernail pry the battery connector up and away from its socket on the logic board grab your y triple zero again and remove the five screws from the logic board cover bracket and use your tweezers to remove the bracket disconnect the lcd panel cable the digitizer and the front panel assembly connector with your spudger or clean fingernail once those are disconnected you can free the display from the rest of the phone at the top of the display we need to remove the front assembly begin by removing four screws three being phillips and one y triple zero use the point of your spudger and gently pry up the top edge of the speaker and flip the speaker assembly down and away from the top edge of the display but don't pull it out yet it's still held in place by a cable using your eye opener heat up the top front of the display for about one to two minutes so that we can soften the adhesive holding down the sensors then carefully slide the edge of your opening pick underneath the flex cable making sure to get under the microphone slowly twist the pick to separate the microphone lifting it up just be really careful with your tweezers slide the small bracket straight up and off the ambient light sensor then use the same tweezers to wiggle the ambient light sensor from its notch in the display don't pull it off the display though it's still attached via the flex cable working from left to right slide your pick beneath the flex cable and underneath the proximity sensor flood illuminator module gently wiggle and lift the earpiece speaker and front sensor assembly to separate it from its notch in the front panel once everything is free set aside your front panel assembly as you'll need to transfer this part to your new display with your new display in hand grab your earpiece speaker and front sensor assembly gently press the proximity sensor and flood illuminator into the respective slots on the display next with some tweezers slide the ambient light sensor back into place and place its bracket straight onto it with your finger gently press the microphone back into place and press the flex cable below the microphone onto the display making sure it's all well adhered you can also use a spudger for this step now you can flip the speaker assembly over and reinstall the four screws securing the front assembly in place before you attach your display you need to add new adhesive so you can retain water resistance in your phone we have a video on how to do that and we'll link to it in the description below bring your display over to your phone and with your clean finger or spudger reconnect all the cables from the display back onto the logic board now you can connect the battery again once finished lay the bracket that covers the connectors back on and screw it back into place if your display still has the adhesive liner go ahead and remove it now we're ready to lay the display back down on the phone carefully lower the display and align the clips along the top edge and then carefully press the top edge into place before you press the rest of the display down if you catch some resistance check the condition of the clips around the perimeter of the display and make sure they're not bent now go ahead and screw back in the pentalobe screws you",

      "title": "Obliterated iPhone 11 Gets Repaired",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge video in this video i'll be trying to repair what's left of this iphone 11. every centimeter of glass is cracked the display has been obliterated with 80 of the top layer missing obviously the last owner did a little more than just drop it but what exactly i don't know i purchased it online in its current condition the seller apparently got it amongst a box of things purchased at a garage sale so there's no telling what really happened to this phone so you'll have to take a guess opening the parcel we can see what i got despite the phone the only other thing included was the horrible smell of battery acid this phone has a serious wobble and it's not just a camera bump the lower section is all pushed outward the impact seems to have been from a sharp blade that's collided with the front of the phone could this be a lord mower incident the big question is will it still power on plugging in a voltage meter you can see the phone isn't drawing a lot of power but still the backlight lit up based on the way it was acting i'd say it was on the battery flat screen exterior wires this phone will need a complete overhaul along with a new battery to begin i'll remove the two apple pentalobe security screws from the bottom of the device from here what's left of the screen can be pried off usually i'd heat the display and carefully remove it using a suction cup but i don't need to be careful with this one so i can use a metal tool to get things started then a few plastic picks can be worked around the perimeter like usual to separate the display from the housing lifting the screen up to the right side reveals the internals of the iphone 11. well i found out why this phone smells like battery acid the cuts to the display have gone through the glass and middle layers of the screen and into the battery along with that the liquid indicators are red and the front camera looks a little odd i also found a fingerprint is that from a worker who assembled this or has someone attempted to get this phone working again if you find a very damaged phone that's been opened it's not a good sign as someone probably failed to get it working before investing the time into repairing this phone i want to test if it works to do that i'll attach a new display and battery the battery connector position on the iphone 11 does almost suggest that you should connect the battery before the display but ensure you don't do that as you can short out the phone destroying it in the process pressing the power button the phone sprung to life i can tell by the date this phone has been out of action since the 9th of november that's over 10 months but now that we know the phone power's on and seems to be working we can continue with the repair we don't need the new display and battery for a while so they can be put aside given the extent of the damage i'll have to transplant the usable components into a new housing starting with the logic board this is the most integral part forming the brain of the phone there are a lot of flex cables to detach some of which are a little hard to get to given the cramped space once everything's detached it can be lifted up and out of the phone next both the rear and front cameras can be removed it's important that the front camera is not damaged during its removal as it's one of apple's many software paired parts any replacement will break face id after they're out there's a couple of antennas that i'll also need to detach i won't need to remove everything as the replacement housing comes with some of the very small parts already installed despite this the process is still incredibly involved with the amount of varying screws not helping the iphone uses a total of four screw heads so you have to keep changing out your screwdriver bits as you go along down at the lower section we can work on getting the sim reader out despite only being a single sim phone you can buy replacement sim readers giving you dual physical sim capability next i can remove the fasteners holding the large metal bracket in place before proceeding to take out the vibration motor and speaker now we are just left with the charging port of course it's held in with more screws that will need to come out prior to its removal and with that we've disassembled the iphone 11 as far as we need to with so many different screws it's important that they're all organized so i know where to put them back when we reassemble i've chosen this mint green color for our new housing they were out of stock of the black one and i thought this one looked better anyway as you can see it's already got a few parts installed i purchased this as a used apple original that had been pulled from a phone but that's far from the truth for starters the wireless charging coil is loose lifting it out you can see it's been attached using thin strips of adhesive this isn't how apple sticks this piece into place the coil itself also has some damage one of the wire strands has been pulled loose yet another thing i'll need to fix with this new housing i'll glue the wireless charger back in place using some liquid adhesive which for this application will work great while i'm at it i'll properly glue the upper antenna it's even complete with strange writing if you needed any more reasons to know this isn't a real apple housing it's just an aftermarket housing with some used or aftermarket parts thrown in it i don't care that it's aftermarket after all apple won't sell you a replacement housing anyway it's just misleading advertising if you take your iphone with a cracked glass back into apple the only repair option they offer is to take the display off and swap the screen onto a complete new phone not even transferring the logic board that's because the glue used to hold the rear glass on is so strong you need laces to remove it the complexity of these repairs doesn't just impact third-party repair but also apple's own offerings meaning if you damage the glass on the back of your iphone the repair cost is almost the price of a new phone because essentially that's what apple gives you i missed a standoff screw from the old housing so i removed it and put it in place where it was needed once the charging port assembly is back in place it's time to remove some plastic protective pieces that cover the display brackets from the old housing and transfer them into the new one following that the sim reader can be attached before proceeding up to the top of the phone where i can attach one bracket followed by two antennas one of the display brackets is mangled and has a piece of metal jutting out so i need to swap it with one from the original housing i purchased this mint green housing with some of the parts already installed to save me some time but i've actually spent more time fixing stupid issues like this it's finally come time to get the logic board back into place it requires quite a bit of fiddling to get seated without trapping any flex cables the upper metal bracket must also be attached prior to it being fully seated once in place i can begin reattaching the flex cables and screwing in the two metal brackets proceeding i can reinstall the face id module and connect its two cables to prevent getting any dust between the cameras and the lens i'll blow some air to free any dust before installing the two cameras switching things up a bit it's time to prep the new display for installation to do this i'll first need to remove the old earpiece cable which also houses the proximity sensor and a microphone again this is paired to the phone so a replacement cable will break face id once removed from the old screen it's time to attach it to our new lcd this one is a refurbished panel meaning the lcd is original but the glass has been replaced this is a way to recycle old cracked screens and results in getting the best replacement display i'll position the earpiece cable and fasten it into place back at the phone i'll get the new battery installed to make sure the alignment of the cable is correct you can plug in the battery before sticking it down just be sure to unplug it again before connecting the display i like to use a handy tool that plugs into the charger to hold the screen in place while i connect its cables and brackets oddly the replacement housing already came with new display adhesive installed so i didn't have to apply any once the screen is attached i can clean off any dust and fingerprints before sealing the display down to the new housing with that i can reinstall the sim card tray and the two pentalobe screws into the bottom of the iphone i can then run the phone through a factory reset and panic when i see the iphone lock to owner screen yeah right i'm the owner and this phone isn't locked imagine all that effort and apple software bricks the phone the phone already activated on my computer so i don't know why it's saying it's locked my guess is ios 15 is keeping the icloud info stored even upon reset so the phone just assumes it's locked either way i could set up the phone as usual now all that's left to do is remove the plastic protective film from both the new display and back glass and we're done so this is it a 64 gigabyte iphone 11 that was once completely obliterated has been resurrected into a working phone surprisingly everything works even after that massive impact including the cameras and face id i was concerned about the front camera as it looked like it had water or heat damage but despite its looks it works as it should of course in typical apple fashion we get a battery and display warning with the battery health being disabled for no reason other than the fact that the software has been programmed to reject replacement parts not installed by apple regardless if genuine and on that note this has been a huge jefferies video if you

      "summary": "Every centimeter of glass is cracked the display has been obliterated with 80 of the top layer missing. The seller apparently got it amongst a box of things purchased at a garage sale so there's no telling what really happened to this phone. backlight lit up based on the way it was acting i'd say it was on the battery flat screen exterior wires this phone will need a complete overhaul along with a new battery to begin i'll remove the two apple pentalobe security screws from the bottom of the device from here what's left of the screen can be pried off. this phone working again if you find a very damaged phone that's been opened it's not a good sign as someone probably failed to get it working before investing the time into repairing this phone. i'll attach a new display and battery the battery connector position on the iphone 11 does almost suggest that you should connect the battery before the display. flex cables to detach some of which are a little hard to get to given the cramped space once everything's detached it can be lifted up and out of the phone next both the rear and front cameras can be removed it's important that the front camera is not damaged during its removal as it's one of apple's many software paired parts any replacement will break face id after they're out. i purchased this as a used apple original that had been pulled from a phone but that's far from the truth for starters the wireless charging coil is loose lifting it out you can see it's been attached using thin strips of adhesive this isn't how apple sticks this piece into place the coil itself also has some damage one of the wire strands has been pulled loose yet another thing i'll need to fix with this new housing i'll glue the coil into place. wireless charger back in place using some liquid adhesive which for this application will work great while i'm at it i'll properly glue the upper antenna it's even complete with strange writing if you needed any more reasons to know this isn't a real apple housing it's just an aftermarket housing with some used or aftermarket parts thrown in it i don't care that it's aftermarket after all apple won't sell you a replacement housing anyway. i missed a standoff screw from the old housing so i removed it and put it in place where it was needed once the charging port assembly is back in place it's time to remove some plastic protective pieces that cover the display brackets. i purchased this mint green housing with some of the parts already installed to save me some time but i've actually spent more time fixing stupid issues like this cables and screwing in the two metal brackets proceeding i can reinstall the face id module and connect its two cables.

      "title": "iPhone 11 Screen Replacement Tutorial - How to fix your phone screen!",
      "transcript": "welcome back to another idor UK video in this video I'm going to show you how to replace the screen on the iPhone 11 using an aftermarket display to start off power down the phone if touch is still available on it and then remove the two pentalobe screws from the bottom of the device once they're removed take a single sided razor blade and create a small incision between the plastic edge of the screen and the metal shassy in insert it a couple of millim and then pry backwards create a larger gap which is now big enough to fit a plasticy tarp pick in there with that inserted a couple of millim we're just going to run it along the edge to separate the screen from the chassis take the razor blade out and continue around the bottom Edge and the left hand edge of the phone don't worry about the top Edge because we can just lift it up and wiggle it out to release the screen now we're in into the device we're going to place a heavy object behind it like a mug and then to begin detaching the screen remove the three screws holding down the shield for the battery cover remove the shield with tweezers and then using a plastic spudger disconnect the battery Flex here so that we can isolate power from the device moving up to this Shield here remove the five triwing screws once the screws are removed remove the shield and then using the plastic sper again remove the connector for the front sensor and ear speaker followed by the two display connectors one for the touch and the other the LCD that'll now free the screen away from the chassis take advantage of being able to remove as much glue as possible and then we'll move on to cleaning the chassis before we prepare the screen the glue on the iPhone 11 is not too bad to remove just take some fine tweezers and begin pulling it up and remove as much of it as possible before taking a cleaning brush and some isopropyl alcohol clean the edges of the chassis we use these repair specific brushes but if you don't have one a clean toothbrush will do the same job it's important to get the chassis as clean as possible at this point failure to do so will mean that the new dust and moisture resistant seal won't sit very well onto the chassis most screens come with a new seal now and this one's no exception so we'll stick that into place and align the edges of it before securing it down with a plastic spoter I'll now remove the first layer of the film some of the peels have different qualities you might find that your screen comes with a blue seal but they do exactly the same job now that the Seal's applied we can remove the a speaker from the broken screen and begin transferring it onto our new display there's one triwing screw in the top left corner of this ear speaker remove that and then remove the three cros head screws in each corner of the ear speaker once they're removed take your tweezers and unfold the ear speaker from the flex cable now take your tweezers again and lift up this small bracket and then using a haird dryer or a heat gun warm up the air area around the proximity sensor microphone and ambient light sensor to soften the adesive underneath so that we can get our tweezers underneath and carefully lift up the sensors without damaging them it's really important to be careful when doing this because if this Flex cable gets damaged it will render face ID obsolete now that the flex Cable's removed we can take our new display remove any pels on the back of the screen then place down the flex cable the same way that you removed it once the flex is lined up you want to take your proximity sensor and line that into place sometimes you might need the tweezers to give it a little nudge followed by the ambient light sensor and at that point the microphone should be secure reinsert that small metal bracket this can be a bit tricky it looks like I've got it in one and then fold over the ear speaker aligning the screw holes they'll secure down the Three cross head screws and the single triwing screw in the top left with those secured now we can move on to transferring the true tone data using a true tone programmer this is an optional step if you have a programming tool but it isn't essential and it won't affect the way that the screen works but basically what we do we take the old screen read the data that's stored in this chip down here here remove it attach the new screen and then write in the data so this just acts as a sort of clipboard for transferring the data from the old screen to the new now I can move that out of the way now we can get the new screen and begin offering up the flex cables one by one once they're lined up just apply a little bit of pressure you'll feel it sort of Click into place it might be a little bit awkward if it's your first time doing this just be patient once they're secured we're not going to put the shield on just yet we're going to rescure the battery and it's a good time to test that your new display works okay it won't do any harm to turn it on like this as long as the connectors are connected properly we can just make sure that touch is good by making sure that it doesn't drop the slider when pressing power off we can see that we've got touch all over which means that we can seal this device up so we'll start off by lining up The Shield at the top and resecuring the five triwing screws I'll just make another note here that all these screws are the same size so it doesn't matter if you muddle them up slightly as long as they're the same screws what came out of the logic board you're not going to do any harm by putting them in a different location now that's secured it's a little bit fider to put the bracket for the battery back on but if you lift up the cables for the screen rescure the bottom two screws first and then we'll peel back the screen cables a little bit so that we can get the top screw in one other thing I've just noticed before I'm going to seal this up and this can be quite common is that this bracket here slips out of its of its housing you just have to pull it back and make sure that it's sat under the little catch so it doesn't lift up if you don't do that then the screen won't sit flush and also runs the risk of damaging the new display now this is ready I'm going to peel back the peel for for the dust a moisture resistant seal and I'll just sort of close the phone now so that I can get the rest of the peel from this side then to make sure that the screen goes back perfectly into place we're going to get the top of the screen first make sure that it Clips in at the top nice and flush with the chassis and then apply pressure in that corner there followed by spinning it around apply pressure there and give it a squeeze on the bottom to make sure that it sits nice and flush we can see we've got a corner what's struggling to go in there I think it's got a little d in the top if that ever happens you can take your razor blade again and just give it a little nudge to make sure that it sits in perfectly we'll turn the device on again and whilst that's booting up we'll just make sure that we rescure the two Penelope screws into the bottom of the phone thank you for watching this video I hope that it's been helpful for you and I'll see you next time",

      "title": "iPhone 11 screen repair/replacement how to fix iPhone 11 screen",
      "transcript": "all right guys today we're going to be fixing an iphone 11 that as you can tell is pretty pretty damaged um this has a lot of screen issues nobody can use a phone so we're going to be replacing this screen anybody can do this repair it's not hard at all it's super easy as long as you have the right tools and most importantly if you take your time and go slow the first thing you want to do is make sure you buy the right screen and you want to check your connections so i know the connections are on this right side of this iphone 11 so i know when i'm taking off the lcd i need to go slowly here's a few of the tools you're going to need the first one is going to be this pentalobe screwdriver i will leave a link in the description to all these tools a tri-wing screwdriver i just call it a y screwdriver i need some anti-static tweezers don't use regular tweezers a nice sesamo or some kind of pry tool and a small phillips screwdriver like i said i'll leave a link in the description to all the tools the first thing you want to do just like with every single iphone before this is you want to remove the two pentalobe screws at the bottom you do have to have this special screwdriver it comes in a lot of kits but you do have to have it to open those screws at the bottom and then you want to go around the sides this video has been sped up so take your time slow it down you don't want to rush anything just remember those cables are on the kind of more to the bottom right side of this phone so when you're prying make sure you don't pry too deep but if you do it's not going to be too big of an issue because you're replacing the lcd anyways but just on that right hand side just go a little bit slower when you're prying up but i usually start at the bottom but if you have any kind of gaps uh starting the gap and and pull out some of them are a little bit harder than others some are easy but when you do finally get it where you can kind of maneuver it and get in there and you've gone all the way around and get all that adhesive out of the way you're going to want to pry this open like a book basically from left to right and once you pry it open don't go past 90 degrees that cable at the far left it's important and you might break it you want to start by removing the five screws on this shield right here and you use the tri-wing screwdriver there's going to be five of them and make sure when you lay them out you lay them out just the way that you took them out it'll make it a lot easier when you're putting them back so you see those two cables right there one's an lcd cable and one's a digitizer cable you want to go ahead and connect disconnect those cables and i always like to disconnect the battery i try to do it if we can right off the bat but with this iphone 11 you have to disconnect the two cables on top and then use your tri-wing screwdriver and remove these three screws that are on this l-shaped bracket and these are all tri-wing screws as well and like i said when you're laying them laying them out just try to lay them out exactly the way that you took it out and lay these brackets right next to them so to make it super easy when we're putting this back together so we're going to disconnect the battery and i usually like to do this first but on this iphone 11 you can't access it first and then now we want to disconnect your front camera mic cable and once you do that i mean the screen is off these newer iphones in my opinion are a lot easier to remove than the old ones this top part right here you're going to want to take your phillips screwdriver there's three phillips screws on this right hand side and once again they're different size screws so make sure that when you lay them out you're laying them out correctly or when you put them back you could cause damage there's one little tiny screw at the top it's a tri-wing screwdriver they like to mix different screws to make it harder to take apart but it's really not so you want to fold that cable down and i kind of got in here a little too close with my camera but um there's a little piece at the top that you want to basically pry loose and when you pry it loose i'm trying to see where you can see how thick it is at the top you want to make sure you get behind that and not cut and cut it in half or anything so you want to pry on that and there's a little um adapter at the top and i'm going to show you that adapter in slow motion here in just a second it's kind of like a little shield so right there at the top you see a little gold plate it's right there it's basically just like a little shield that helps hold it down i had to get that off to remove it and i didn't show that in the video prior so just make sure you lift up that little shield right there and it should just come right off and once that comes off the other parts a lot easier to get out but i'm basically doing everything in reverse order now so i'm pushing this little plate back into its spot um once i've you know put the front camera and mic back in and i just want to make sure that it fits flush but i was trying to slow that down just to show you what that bracket looks like because i missed it in the other part so the brackets in i'm just making sure everything fits down flush solid and then right now i'm trying to line up the screw holes and make sure that nothing looks like it's too far apart from each other or like a screw when you screw it in it's not going to fit or anything and everything right here looks pretty good so we're just going in reverse order we're gonna put um our take our phillips screwdriver and put our three screws back in once we put our uh three screws back in we're going to grab our y screwdriver our tri-wing screwdriver and we're going to screw that little bitty screw in at the very top and if you need to you can um slow this video down it sped up a little bit just to kind of so you get to the point of it but take your time pause the video don't rush um it's the only time i ever see anybody mess up is when you rush it's it's not a hard repair at all um so we're gonna take these cables and we're gonna we're going to put them back in the exact same spot we pulled them out from so you want to connect the battery you want to connect these two cables and i always like to connect the battery last so i went under these cables and did it but i uh connected all the cables and we basically just want to test this phone out before we start putting down the plates and the screws and all that to make sure that the phone functions the way that it should um and i had to uh pull out those two cables and then put the battery down to make this work so it just adds up i want to put the battery connector first and then the lcd and digitizer we're gonna go ahead and power this iphone on and sometimes you get the passcode sometimes you don't so if you don't have the passcode you can swipe up on the phone and click emergency and then just type one two three four five six seven eight nine pound zero you wanna make sure that everything you touch the right thing comes up on the screen and if it does then everything is connected and it should be fine you can do a phone call test if you want to because you mess with that front cam uh mic at the top um so you can always have them call you or you can call them make sure they can hear you and you can hear them that's just an extra step but i've had no problems with these newer iphones um having any kind of issues um the camera's at a bad angle so i apologize i was focused on getting this done in a timely manner you're going to take that l-shape bracket that you put and you're going to want to put the three tri-ring screws back but before you do that you want to make sure that that battery connector is is connected and it's down once you do that you're going to connect your lcd and your digitizer those are the two cables on the top and then you're going to want to grab your shield over here in a minute that's right there on the right side and you want to going to grab that shield and lay it on top and if you just line it up with the screw holes there's five screw holes and if you've laid out your screws correctly you can just put those back the way that they're laid out and it makes it super simple like i said this repair is not hard whatsoever anybody can do it you just got to make sure you take your time and your patience and your patience sorry but i did speed up this video on bits and pieces just to to get through it but it's maybe takes about 30 45 minutes at the most and that's if you are taking your time and doing it correctly when you're putting this in at the end you want to make sure you push on the bottom of the screen towards the top of the phone that helps it sit in just right and the last thing you need to do is just put in your last two pentalobe screws and that's it this iphone 11 is done you can turn it on and once again go through your test do the emergency test check your numbers all that you can make a phone call if you want to but other than that i mean all you did was replace the screen uh so hopefully this this helped you out like i said anybody can do it uh if this helped you in any way please uh let me know thank you",

      "summary": "Anyone can do this repair it's not hard at all it's super easy as long as you have the right tools and most importantly if you take your time and go slow the first thing you want to do is make sure you buy the right screen. you want to do just like with every single iphone before this is you want to remove the two pentalobe screws at the bottom. Just remember those cables are on the kind of more to the bottom right side of this phone so when you're prying make sure you don't pry too deep. out of the way you're going to want to pry this open like a book basically from left to right and once you pry it open don't go past 90 degrees that cable at the far left it's important and you might break it you want to start by removing the five screws on this shield right here and you use the tri-wing screwdriver. exactly the way that you took it out and lay these brackets right next to them so to make it super easy when we're putting this back together. We're going to disconnect the battery and i usually like to do this first but on this iphone 11 you can't access it first. Then we want to disconnect your front camera mic cable and once you do that i mean the screen is off these newer iphones in my opinion are a lot easier to remove than the old ones. little piece at the top that you want to basically pry loose and when you pry it loose i'm trying to see where you can see how thick it is at the bottom. You want to make sure you get behind that and not cut and cut it in half or anything. Once that comes off the other parts a lot easier to get out. slow that down just to show you what that bracket looks like because i missed it in the other part so the brackets in i'm just making sure everything fits down flush solid and then right now i'm trying to line up the screw holes and make sure that nothing looks like it's too far apart from each other. i always like to connect the battery last so i went under these cables and did it but i uh connected all the cables. We basically just want to test this phone out before we start putting down the plates and the screws and all that to make sure that the phone functions the way that it should. connected and it should be fine you can do a phone call test if you want to because you mess with that front cam uh mic at the top um so you can always have them call you or you can call them make sure they can hear you. you've laid out your screws correctly you can just put those back the way that they're laid out and it makes it super simple like i said this repair is not hard whatsoever anybody can do it you just got to make sure you take your time. uh if this helped you in any way please uh let me know thank you.",

      "title": "iPhone 11 Pro Max Teardown - Tiny Motherboard &amp; BIG Battery!",
      "transcript": "the iphones have always been some of the most complicated phones to take apart you'll see why over the course of this video but there's no way we could let this iphone 11 pro max flagship slip by without seeing the insides this is the most water resistant mainstream smartphone money can buy right now so it's time to see what helps keep water out and how repairable it really is let's get started since basically day one of the first iphone's existence apple has been in the business of trying to keep people out of their phones and this new iphone appears to be no different it has the same proprietary pentalobe screws holding the bottom of the screen to the stainless steel frame of the phone it uses a screwdriver that's pretty easy to find online but most people don't immediately have it on hand i'll leave a link for a good tool kit in the description looking closely at the screw it has black thread locker filling the gaps between the threads and the phone body this helps keep the screw in place as well as helps keep water out the biggest opening for water to get inside the phone though is the screen there is adhesive surrounding the whole rectangle in order to pull the screen off i'll need to use heat to soften that adhesive and a strong suction cup to pull on the screen while adding some leverage with my pry tool between the plastic lip and the stainless steel frame as i work my way around either side of the phone lifting off the display you can see the substantial amount of stringy gooey black adhesive that holds the parts together i'm taking special care to avoid the ribbon cables hiding along the edge of the right side these cables are about as fragile as paper and can be torn very easily you'll get a better look at them as the screen lifts off they're down there through those gooey strands at first glance things look pretty standard for the iphone a ton of screws and the massive l-shaped battery thumbs up to apple for adding battery life and thickness to their phones this year instead of trying to go thinner i'm also glad that the ribbons are all off to the side last year had a random ribbon cable coming from the center that made the screen removal quite a bit harder the front camera and face scanner are tucked up in the top of the phone i'll remove these six y triple zero screws holding the middle plate over the top of the screen ribbon connectors one of those screws is easier to access from the other side of the screen if you close and scooch it over a bit and take a look at that motherboard it's lego connector central up in here happy birthday to myself i'll remove another four y triple zero screws that hold the top protective metal plate and side ribbon guide down over the camera units and there are two more screws holding down the tiny plate over the battery connector before i unplug that battery though i want to make sure this whole thing still works and that nothing was damaged during the screen removal tapping the power button shows the apple logo and the phone turns on which app should i test to make sure the phone still works maybe i should use today's sponsor audible that was convenient audible is actually one of my favorite apps the book i'm currently listening to is called the man who knew the way to the moon and is one of the audible originals it sounds more like a verbal documentary than a narration i usually adjust the speed to be a tad faster than normal so i can get through more information quicker it's a true story about the guy who convinced nasa to use space rendezvous points instead of one gigantically massive rocket it's super interesting you can get a free audio book plus two audible originals when you try audible for 30 days with the link in the description audible.com jerryrig or text the word jerryrig to 500 500. the audible original titles come from diverse categories like theater journalism literature and the documentary styles like the one i'm listening to now even if you decide to cancel audible at some point in the future you still get to keep your books they're yours to own forever audible.com jerryrig or text jerry rigged to 500 500 and thanks to audible for sponsoring this video i'll unclip the battery connector like a little lego from this smorgasbord of lego connectors the battery actually has two connectors one is found down below by the charging port so when clipping both of those is a good idea at this point i just didn't know the second one existed until later i'll unclip one of the charging port ribbons and then i'll make my way down to the three main ribbons holding the screen to the body of the phone the screen is significantly more simple this year than it has been for the previous years which is definitely appreciated it only has three screws holding the earpiece to the back of the display apple throws phillips head screws randomly in here and there throughout the phone so for those of you following along at home this is the third type of screwdriver we've used so far the earpiece folds down which lets us pry away the front sensors from the glass replacement parts will become more common and get cheaper as the phones get older i'll try to link some in the video description as they become available screen replacements aren't super difficult on iphones and with the disappearance of 3d touch the display is actually thinner and leaves more room for the larger battery speaking of which i've had a few requests for a straight up clean video shot of the internals so feel free to screenshot this crop it and use it as your phone wallpaper if you want just make sure to tag me on twitter if you do let's remove the front camera and the face id death scanner thingy it's got two ribbon cables to unplug wait nope there's three last one kind of just snuck in there this little unit has the front 12 megapixel selfie camera the one that can film in 4k and do those slow fees and also has the infrared dot projector and secondary camera for the face id it's a pretty cool setup and i'm glad it's not attached to the screen it makes repairs easier the three rear cameras each have their own ribbon cable attached to the motherboard i can unclip each of those and then the whole contraption comes right out of the phone apple really has made their design much more modular this year and i'm a fan up at the top we get the normal 12 megapixel camera with optical image stabilizing down at the bottom we get another 12 megapixel two times optical zoom camera which also has optical image stabilizing and over here on the side we have a 12 megapixel wide angle camera with no physical stabilizing i feel like this is the perfect setup and the arrangement i would personally like to have someday when i upgrade from my galaxy s8 i feel like apple has finally brought way more features to the table with smartphones this year and are finally competing at the same level of other flagships let's get this motherboard out i'll unplug the charging port ribbon but before i can pull that out once again i need to switch back to the y triple zero screwdriver there are three screws running down the right side keeping this cable with the metal bracket tucked to the side of the phone the next three screws are a bit trickier these are called standoff screws and they hold the motherboard in place if you don't have a standoff remover i can usually take a flat screwdriver bit and just twist the screw around in the circle from one side and as the screw comes out you can see that a standoff screw is actually a screw that has a screw hole inside a screw within a screw they are annoying to work with but apple uses them to save space and stack things on top of each other speaking of saving space once those screws are out and the sim card tray is removed the whole motherboard is ready to come out of the phone and this my friends is it this is the whole thing the brains and brawn of the whole iphone operation is sandwiched between these two stacked boards one thing i'm pretty impressed with on the iphones this time around is that all the solder connecting the circuits inside of this motherboard is made from 100 recycled tin you might be thinking nice work apple on recycling that tiny drop of tin but because apple is using recycled tin and not only their iphones but the macbook air the ipad air and the ipad mini it adds up to over 29 000 metric tons of tin ore that they don't need to mine from the earth it's a pretty substantial achievement and i'm glad apple's doing it let's keep going deeper the taptic vibrator engine is down here below the battery near the charging port it's got three little screws holding it in place and i'm going to set those off to the side to help keep things organized a lot of phones you can take apart and just toss the screws held or skelter but since basically every screw in here is a different shape and size it's very important to keep them organized with the metal plate gone and the vibrator unclipped from the charging port we get our first close-up of the taptic engine it's nice of apple to include their logo in case we forgot what phone we're taking apart this little guy is also using 100 recycled rare earth elements since we don't have an unlimited earthly supply of these magnets i'm glad apple is now going through the effort to reuse and recycle parts of their phones i'll remove one more screw and pull off the metal plate over the microphone hole and check out all that white adhesive over the hole to help keep water out of the microphone it's time to remove the battery apple once again has added the magic pull tabs which i'm thankful for prying out permanently glued batteries is extremely dangerous and even if a pride and bent battery doesn't spark and start on fire right away it'll still be damaged internally and will start to puff up and expand over time these pull tabs make battery removal much safer yeah they are still pretty fragile and break every now and then but it's still much better than what samsung is currently doing with the permanent adhesive and their phone apple has three pull strips at the end of each side of the battery and i was successful enough with most of them that the rest of the battery can be lifted up unharmed this is a 3969 milliamp hour capacity which is quite an improvement over last year's 3174 milliamp hours for real apple has come out to play this time the loudspeaker comes out next with its two screws holding it in place you might have noticed so far that while the iphone seems complex most components are still modular and come out relatively easily you can see the substantial amount of black adhesive holding the loudspeaker to the frame of the phone like i said in my durability test video this iphone 11 pro max is the most water resistant smartphone on the market right now while most manufacturers have water tested their phones to a depth of 1.5 or 2 meters deep for 30 minutes just to get that ip68 rating apple has gone above and beyond and tested the new iphone 11 pros to 4 meters deep for 30 minutes double the depth of what everyone else is doing hold on for a second though check this out the loudspeaker is full of a ton of those little white sound balls i assume these white balls help fill the space inside of the tiny little cell phone speaker to keep it from sounding like a tiny little cell phone speaker i'll take out the last nine screws for the charging port and get back to that ip rating even though apple went twice as deep as everyone else they still only got the same ip68 rating you're probably like why didn't they just go up a level to ip69 and that's because ip69 is a totally different test instead of submersion it's a high pressure and temperature water jet test and pretty irrelevant for cell phones cell phones get accidentally submerged all the time but getting accidentally blasted by a fire truck is far less common the charging port is finally out of the phone that was definitely a nightmare i don't want to repeat the iphone has so many intricate components it's not so much a difficult phone to repair it's just a very complex phone to repair and one wrong move or screw in the wrong place could wreck the phone if you do end up breaking your back glass and don't have insurance you can either pay apple 599 to fix it or just buy a replacement housing and swap over each component individually yeah it's going to be pretty extremely painful either way apple's still kind of being a big jerk where that's concerned i think you should just get a case before it breaks i'm pretty impressed with apple for stepping up and going above and beyond the bare minimum that they usually do this time apple has given customers the specs and features they're paying for and that always hasn't been true in the past of course in my opinion androids can still accomplish more i'm not ready to switch size just yet but i am glad that apple has stepped up with enough performance to match the price tag and is doing it with recycled and recyclable materials we can all appreciate and support that i'll get the camera units put back into their slot they are all housed in the same metal block so it's impossible to get them out of alignment and the same thing goes for the front cameras finally the front screen with its three ribbon cables can plug into the tiny motherboard and i can start throwing down all those metal plates over the lego style ribbon connectors the last thing that gets plugged in is the battery and this little metal bracket that covers the top then we can turn the phone back on and once again i'm just as surprised as you are that this thing still works i for one am glad that apple has started participating again in the smartphone race and even more so for using recycled components innovations in both areas are good for everyone i'll be looking into the recycling efforts of other manufacturers in the future so hit that subscribe button if you haven't already it's free and remember that the computer the astronauts

      "title": "$75 Destroyed iPhone 11 Pro Max Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge jefferies video in this video i'm going to be trying to resurrect this iphone 11 pro max that i purchased for 100 australian dollars or around 75 usd which is an amazing price for last year's iphone model however this one has been completely destroyed by its previous owner the back glass is completely obliterated and the entire frame is bent resulting in the screen popping out of its frame how did it end up like this well apparently it got wedged into a bed frame and someone jumped on the bed destroying the phone while the screen appears to be intact i was told the phone no longer lights up buying a bent phone is quite a gamble as it could have major board issues or the phone could be completely dead before ordering any parts for this phone i'm going to test whether the phone even charges plugging this iphone 11 pro max into the charger nothing appears on display so i'll use an amp meter to verify it's drawing about an amp of current which should indicate it's charging don't plug the phone into a computer as recent ios updates block connections with usb devices after a restart so it could be easily misdiagnosed as dead as my phone appears to be working i've gone ahead and ordered a new rear housing and frame as well as a new display getting a closer look at the housing you can see it's completely empty so we'll need to transfer all of the phone's internals into this new housing getting started i'll remove the two pentalobe screws from the bottom of the iphone since there is a huge hole in the side of this phone inserting a plastic pick to start lifting up that front display is a lot easier than it usually is i didn't need any heat or even a suction cup i will use this pick to cut through the adhesive holding in the display it's also clipped into place on the sides and top so i'll need to unlatch the clips to be able to lift up the display to the side getting our first look inside i will start by removing the display and battery connections to do this i'll be removing three brackets and five cables the brackets are secured with tri-wing screws so you'll require a specific screwdriver to remove them i will leave a link to a page on my website where you can get a list of all the tools i use so you can get the right tool to perform a repair just like this with both battery cables disconnected i will unplug the display and remove it from our phone i will immediately connect a replacement display so we can test the phone before we dive any deeper with our repair connecting up the two display cables and the two battery connections we can power on the phone plugging it in you can see it's flat after letting it charge it booted right up to a lock screen i will need to reset this phone but it seems to be working so it's time to dive deeper with this repair i'll disconnect our two battery connections and take off our new display we'll be needing it later but we need to fix the back of the phone first before we can seat our new screen in i'll start by removing the rear cameras by unscrewing one bracket and several flex cables carefully lifting it out of place we can put it aside for later i'll also disconnect our face id module and remove it from the phone this is a paired component so we need to ensure that we don't damage it in the removal process so we can reuse it later after disconnecting the flex cable going to the lower portion of the iphone i'll remove the three screws and sim card tray holding in place our logic board pulling that out we can get a closer look at it as this logic board is composed of two boards soldered together it's common to experience issues when a phone becomes bent such as no touch no network or activation issues this one looks perfect and has no bend so fingers crossed it's fully working with the logic board removed i'll proceed by removing the charging port speaker and taptic engine there are a massive amount of screws to keep track of for this part so i highly recommend using a magnetic mat to put screws and parts on to avoid losing them making things more tedious apple has also chosen to use four types of screw heads in this phone so you'll need to keep changing bits throughout the repair the charging port uses phillips tri-wing and a standoff screw time i'm unsure on why they'll use tri-wing screws but i believe it may be to deter repair early iphones were entirely held together with just phillips screws after removing the charging port it's time to detach the battery it's held in with three adhesive strips in previous iphone models these were very easy to break off leaving you with a lot of work to try and remove the battery it appears these newer tabs are stronger and will likely break less than the old ones however i still think this battery is held down with too much adhesive a trick to removing the battery tabs in one piece is to keep them as flat and straight as possible and pull them as close as possible to the battery if removed successfully the battery will literally fall out of the phone it's now time to start working on the real tiny pieces inside this iphone housing starting with all of this antenna assembly up the top it is screwed and adhered into place in several parts of the phone whilst i'm at it i'll also unscrew the power button rear-facing microphone and flash with the microphone being adhered into place i'll need to apply some isopropyl alcohol and carefully lift it out of place i can also use this alcohol to remove any of the sticky residue holding in place any of the flex cables and other antennas i'll unscrew the power button and remove the flex cable this will give me access to be able to remove the antenna assembly i was working on earlier using more alcohol i can soften the adhesive on the antenna pads and remove them from the housing while the phone is now looking quite empty there is still more that needs to come out at the top i'll remove two gold contacts the mesh for the rear microphone and the sim eject pin at the bottom of the phone i'll remove a display retaining bracket and proceed in removing the mesh and plastic spacers in the speaker and microphone ports this is some really fine work that requires a lot of precision it's a shame the new housing comes with absolutely nothing as if it even just had a few of these smaller components it would make the repair so much easier regardless i'll need to move to the left hand side of the phone where i can unscrew more display retaining brackets and the volume and mute switch all that's left to do now is to remove the wireless charging coil and this can prove quite challenging i used some alcohol to try and soften the adhesive underneath i found the best place to pry was at the bottom underneath the cable as you can see when removing it it kind of looks like i've separated the two halves however what remains is just a piece of foil which has been adhered to the back of the glass i couldn't get this out in one piece but it's not necessary anyway we now finally have everything removed i needed two ifixit magnetic mats to fit all the parts on while i haven't counted there has to be close to 100 screws holding this phone together in comparison most android phones come apart with about 10 to 15 screws it's now time to crack open our replacement iphone 11 pro max rear housing this one comes with all the buttons sim tray and the little clips that hold the buttons on the buttons even come with the rubber gasket already installed i could use the old buttons as well if i chose to but i'm going to be using these nice new ones which have no scratches on them at all after pressing them into place i will fasten the retaining clip to the back of each button one thing not included with my new housing was this little spring that attaches to the back of the retaining clip so i'll need to transfer my old ones from the old housing to the new one simply attaching them with tweezers our buttons are ready to go i'll need to install the wireless charging coil first i'll clean off any remaining glass that came up when i remove the coil i'll then apply some new adhesive and adhere it back into position cleaning off any excess glue afterwards with it glued back in i can fasten the screws for the mute switch and volume controls i'll then reinstall all of the metal clips on the side of the frame which hold in place the display panel after reinstalling the sim eject pin i can reapply this plastic piece going over the screws i can reposition this antenna flex cable and the power button assembly after installing the mesh grille and microphone i noticed that one of the standoffs was slightly bent so using the end of my tweezers i was able to bend it back into position so i could correctly install the bracket on top afterwards there's a massive amount of tri-wing screws that i'll need to reinstall which secure the rest of the antenna and flex cables in place for the upper portion of this iphone it's now time to turn our attention to the lower portion of our iphone housing where i can install the mesh grilles for the speaker and microphone arrays these were quite difficult to line up but using a pair of tweezers i was able to get them installed i could then refasten our charging port into position apple uses adhesive around the speaker and microphone holes in my case those adhesive gaskets disintegrated when i remove the charging port as i don't have any to replace them with water could possibly enter the device if it were submerged although this could happen anyway as the device was never fully waterproof after installing the taptic engine and speaker back into our iphone 11 pro max it's time to turn our attention to the battery the battery that came out of here has a slight bend to it nothing alarming so i'll just simply bend it back into a straight position i'll also apply some adhesive strips in a similar fashion to the original configuration as i didn't have the specific battery tabs for this iphone i used some from an iphone 10 and cut them to my needs applying them into position i can press them down with a spudger and we're good to go proceeding i can install the device's logic board back into position and fasten its three screws after reconnecting a flex cable i'll get the three rear-facing cameras installed and reconnect a few other cables after installing the gold tabs that sit underneath the face id sensor i can install the sensor itself and reconnect it to the device's logic board before i install any more screws i'm going to test out our iphone to ensure it's still working after our housing replacement connecting up the display and battery we can see that it still lights up with the apple logo and boots up successfully so we'll continue on with our repair disconnecting that battery and display once again we can continue reassembling our phone i'll give the internals a good clean as we go to ensure there's no fingerprints or dust left inside i'll remove the protective plastic film from the back of the battery and install it into position i can then fasten the bracket holding in the charging port cable turning our tension to the top of the phone i noticed that i installed a screw into the wrong position so swapping that around i can install the bracket for the camera and face id cable proceeding we can start working on the new display for every iphone model starting with the iphone 8 you need to reprogram the display with the old display serial numbers in order to retain apple's true tone feature using a device like this jc programmer allows us to read the old screen's data and write it to our new display panel afterwards on the old screen i can unscrew the old earpiece flex cable applying some heat using a heat mat or heat gun can assist in removing the sensors that are glued in at the top these are paired to each iphone and breaking them will break face id after carefully removing it from our old display i can transfer it to our new one positioning everything into place i can press it down and fold across our earpiece screwing it back into position removing the protective film from the display this completes our display assembly the last thing we'll need to do is to connect the two halves together i will apply a new water resistant seal which will go in between our frame and new display panel after attaching that i can connect the three display cables the two battery connections and the three brackets which hold everything down into place after fastening the 12 tri-wing screws i can now remove the protective film on the adhesive and seat the display panel to the frame carefully lining up the top portion of the screen first i can then press everything firmly down into position i'll now need to remove the protective film going around the edges of our new housing which will reveal the bottom screw holes installing the two pentalobe screws the phone is sealed up i'll reinstall the sim card tray and remove the protective film on both the back and front of the display i'll also install a tempered glass screen protector and we're almost done the last thing i'll need to do is restore this phone to factory settings it currently has the previous owner's data and passcode still on the device after restoring the phone i was able to successfully set it up with no troubles i was able to successfully set up face id and truetone is still working thanks to us reprogramming the display prior to installing it with the phone set up we're done so this is it a once destroyed iphone 11 pro max is now fully functional and in perfect condition but you're probably wondering how much did this all cost the phone plus the repair cost totaled 412 australian or around 313 usd used on ebay here in australia these phones sell for around 950 to 1 100 so that's a minimum saving of 538 dollars that's a massive profit for just a few hours work fixing up a broken one this particular phone is a gig unit running ios 14.3 unlike my other iphone 11 pro max on ios 13 i didn't receive a non-genuine display warning message i'm unsure whether this is because the device is out of warranty or restoring the phone immediately after replacing the display stops the message or maybe even apple has removed these messages in ios 14.3 but i'm surprised nevertheless and on that note this has been a huge jefferies video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the restoration playlist for more videos just

      "summary": "i'm going to be trying to resurrect this iphone 11 pro max that i purchased for 100 australian dollars or around 75 usd. The back glass is completely obliterated and the entire frame is bent resulting in the screen popping out of its frame. don't plug the phone into a computer as recent ios updates block connections with usb devices after a restart so it could be easily misdiagnosed as dead as my phone appears to be working. I've gone ahead and ordered a new rear housing and frame as well as a new display. br brackets and five cables the brackets are secured with tri-wing screws so you'll require a specific screwdriver to remove them. i will leave a link to a page on my website where you can get a list of all the tools i use so you canget the right tool to perform a repair just like this. unscrewing one bracket and several flex cables carefully lifting it out of place we can put it aside for later i'll also disconnect our face id module and remove it from the phone this is a paired component so we need to ensure that we don't damage it in the removal process so we can reuse it later. more tedious apple has also chosen to use four types of screw heads in this phone so you'll need to keep changing bits throughout the repair the charging port uses phillips tri-wing and a standoff screw time. inside this iphone housing starting with all of this antenna assembly up the top it is screwed and adhered into place in several parts of the phone. i'll need to apply some isopropyl alcohol and carefully lift it out of place. There is still more that needs to come out at the top. spacers in the speaker and microphone ports this is some really fine work that requires a lot of precision it's a shame the new housing comes with absolutely nothing as if it even just had a few of these smaller components it would make the repair so much easier regardless i'll need to move to the left hand side of the phone where i can unscrew more display retaining brackets and the volume and mute switch all that's left to do now is to remove the wireless charging coil. be close to 100 screws holding this phone together in comparison most android phones come apart with about 10 to 15 screws. This one comes with all the buttons sim tray and the little clips that hold the buttons on the buttons even come with the rubber gasket already installed. i can install the mesh grilles for the speaker and microphone arrays. These were quite difficult to line up but using a pair of tweezers i was able to bend it back into position so i could correctly install the bracket on top. i can then reinstall all of the metal clips on the side of the frame which hold in place the display panel. was able to get them installed i could then refasten our charging port into position apple uses adhesive around the speaker and microphone holes in my case those adhesive gaskets disintegrated when i remove the charging port as i don't have any to replace them with water could possibly enter the device if it were submerged. fasten its three screws after reconnecting a flex cable i'll get the three rear-facing cameras installed and reconnect a few other cables after installing the gold tabs that sit underneath the face id sensor i can install the sensor itself and reconnect it to the device's logic board before i install any more screws. test out our iphone to ensure it's still working after our housing replacement connecting up the display and battery. swapping that around i can install the bracket for the camera and face id cable proceeding we can start working on the new display for every iphone model.

      "title": "iPhone 11 Pro Max Screen Replacement Guide - How To Change Your Broken Phone Screen!",
      "transcript": "in this video I'm going to show you step-by-step instructions on how to replace the front screen on the iPhone 11 Pro Max to begin the repair take a pentalobe screwdriver and remove the two screws at the bottom of the device and keep those safe for later you can now create a small Gap using a razor blade between the edge of the screen and the chassis of the phone pry backwards to lift the screen up creating a bigger Gap so that we can insert the guitar pick into it which we can now slide along the edge of the device to separate it from the chassis continue running along the bottom Edge again and then the right hand Edge to separate the screen once those three edges are separated you can just lift the screen up wiggle it about a bit and unfold the screen just like that we can see in this example that the screen has been replaced before but the steps to remove it are still the same take a tri-wing screwdriver now and remove the two screws holding down this small rectangular Shield then use tweezers to remove it revealing the battery connector which we can now disconnect using a plastic opening tool there is six more triwing screws holding down this larger Shield just above the battery connector remove all six of those with that Shield out of the way we can take the plastic opening tool and remove the LCD or OLED connector then the touch connector and finally the a speaker and front sensor connector that means that the screen is now free from the chassis and we can begin now removing the a speaker and front sensor Flex by removing the two crad screws on the right hand side and the triwing screw that's on the left to remove this now simply unfold the a speaker away from the chassis and then you may have to use a little bit of heat to warm up this area if it's not been removed before but in this case it has and it's quite loose so we're just going to lift up the ambient light sensor proximity sensor and microphone to remove it from the back of the display we can now get the replacement screen ready which I will link in the description below it includes a screen and a dust and moisture resistant seal which we'll install next to prepare the new screen remove any of these plastic films that are on the back of the display then carefully place down the ambient light sensor into it little bracket that it sits into make sure that it sits all the way in followed by the proximity sensor that sort of Clips in and the micro phone needs to sit flat we can then fold over the a speaker and then reinstall those three screws that we removed so that we could free it the two cross heads on the right and the single triwing just on the left to prepare the chassis for the installation of the new screen you need to remove any leftover adhesive that might have been left behind when you took the screen off just use tweezers to lift it up carefully and peel it away from the chassis we can now use a little bit of isopropyl alcohol and a cleaning brush to make sure that the chassis is really clean with the chassis cleaned we're going to get that new duster moisture resistance seal now and I always place it in the top left corner first secure it along this left hand Edge and then the rest of it will follow as long as the first Edge that you secure it down lines up nicely if you found that it's not sat completely flat just take the back edge of the spider and push it down you can now peel back the top layer of the film now we can offer up the screen and I always start with this top left connector line that up and the rest should follow fairly easily you just might have to wiggle it around a little bit so that you get it in line make sure that these push in all the way because if you get no image after turning it on on it's probably because it's not connected or you have a faulty screen just be careful when you're putting the shield down because sometimes it can get stuck on the bit of plastic film just there or sat on top of it which gets it Tangled when you come to remove that last layer of plastic film so just keep an eye out for that but go ahead and reinstall those six screws that hold it down just make sure that all the screws go back because they are important for holding this fun together with the six screws now reinstalled we're going to move down to the battery and reconnect that followed by the small rectangular Shield going into place and then the two triwing screws that hold that down this can sometimes be a bit awkward so get one in first just Loosely then secure down the other one so that it lines up quite easily just like that this would be a good point to test that the phone works before sealing it up but for the sake of the video I'm just going to go ahead with peeling off the last layer of that adhesive seal and then we're going to fold the screen shut just like the feeling you get when you finish a great novel and we're going to make sure that this top of the screen sits in the top first just like when we opened it up and then with that secure we can squeeze on the edges lightly to make sure that it all sits into place there should be no gaps between the chassis and the screen and it should sit fairly flush to the chassis rescure the two pentalobe screws now now that the screen secured down and closed up we can just plug the power back into the device and hopefully this thing turns on with no problems at all now that this thing turns back on we can do a quick functionality check on it and that just about completes this video on how to replace the screen on the iPhone 11 Pro Max thank you for watching and see you next time",

      "title": "iPhone 11 Pro Max Restoration - Apples trying to stop DIY repair, again.",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge jefferies video in this video i'm going to be restoring this iphone 11 pro max 64 gig it currently has a badly cracked screen non-functioning cameras and no led flash with this phone costing upwards of 1 900 here in australia let's see how repairable it is and if there's any limitations or lockdown mechanisms apple has put in place to stop people from repairing their own phones like we've seen in the past as for our faulty cameras with the stock ios app it won't display anything for any camera modes and crashes when you capture a photo however using a third-party app we can see the wide-angle camera still works but the other two don't the rear flash also appears not to be working in settings we can confirm this is a 64 gig iphone 11 pro max on ios 13.1.5 and is actually still under apple warranty until early next year i did purchase this phone off ebay a couple of months ago included with it i got the fast charger usb seater lightning cable and the phone itself which was packaged in half of its original box what happened to that other half i don't know but before we get started i'd like to thank my mates over at ifixit for sending across some parts to make this video happen if you're looking for some parts tools or guides be sure to check them out i'll leave a link down below what we have to fix this phone is a new display camera and adhesive for that display panel to begin i'll need to shut down the iphone and remove the two apple specific pentalobe screws from the bottom i can then use a heat gun to soften the adhesive under the display in doing this i aim to be able to lift up the display using a suction cup just enough that i can insert a plastic pick i had to heat the display a number of times before the adhesive had softened enough with the pick inserted i simply run it around the edges to unclip the display from the frame lifting it up we get our first glimpse inside this iphone inside is even a fingerprint from the factory worker that put this phone together i'll need to remove three brackets from the phone to be able to get access to all the cables that i'll need to disconnect these brackets are held in place with tri-wing screws likely to prevent people from attempting repairs on their phone however my ifixit protect toolkit comes with all the bits i'll need for this repair with the necessary brackets removed i can disconnect the two battery connections before proceeding this is the most important step to ensure nothing gets shorted out during the repair process after removing three more cables for the front display i can simply lift it out of place with the screen out of the road it's time to turn our attention to the rear cameras our new cameras come as one whole assembly with all three sensors the camera module is easy to access and remove after detaching the face id cable bracket only two more screws need to be unfastened for the camera bracket to come out after which three cables need to be unplugged before the camera can be lifted out of place we can see several dents on the back of this module that have been caused by the impact on the front of the screen with the old camera removed it's time to get our new one fastened into place i'll connect up the three flex cables and clean off this little stamp on the back before i go and put that metal bracket back into place it clips underneath the frame so it can take a little bit of time to get aligned correctly with those screws reinstalled it's time to move across to our front display panel apple has paired the earpiece and proximity sensor flex cable to each iphone to retain apple's face id unlock you'll need to transfer this cable to the new display panel using a bit of heat will assist with the delicate removal of the proximity light sensor and microphone if this cable is damaged face id will not work unless you pay apple to do another screen replacement to the phone to which they'd pair a new one this is a similar situation to apple's unreplaceable home button found in the iphone 7 and newer for our new display panel we've got this one here from ifixit pulling it out of the box you can see that it does not have this earpiece cable attached to it so we'll need to screw that into place the installation process is a lot less daunting than removing it as you only need to press everything back down and reinstall three screws with a new screen ready to go i'm going to test out the phone for this i'm purposely leaving the front earpiece disconnected to demonstrate that face id will be disabled i'll place an insulator between the cable so it doesn't short anything out during the test you can see face id has now been disabled also being displayed is a notice that the phone's screen isn't original so it appears apple is now powering the display to the phone let's see if i can overcome that issue disconnecting our new display i'll reprogram it with this jc v1s we are going to be transferring the old display data from our original apple screen to our new screen using this little tool simply connecting the old one pressing read and connecting our new screen and pressing right all that data will be put onto our new ifixit screen before we test out the display i'm going to clean the edges of our iphone housing to remove all of the old adhesive which was holding down the display while the screen is mainly held in with clips the adhesive provides the phone with some form of water and dust resistance unfortunately replacing this seal is an overlooked part for many repairers getting out our new adhesive we can apply it onto the phone making sure to align it correctly and press it down into place with a spudger removing the top layer of protective film from the adhesive will allow us to reconnect our new display connect up our battery and reinstall the remaining brackets if you ever plan to replace your battery in the iphone 11 series be prepared to deal with one of those notifications saying that the battery is not genuine because you bet apple also pairs the battery into this phone using some alcohol i could clean out the insides of the phone to remove any dust or fingerprints i may have left inside before removing the protective film from the adhesive before i seal everything in i'm going to give the phone a quick test and you can see an important display message appears even after reprogramming it it's still not happy we'll take a look at that in just a minute however we can see the true tone and our camera is functioning as it should proceeding i can install our display panel starting at the top of the phone and working down to the bottom the last thing that's left to do is reinstall the two pentalobe screws into the bottom and of course remove the protective film from the screen and we're done so this is it a working but imperfect iphone 11 pro max i have never come across such a phone that's been so professionally designed not to be repaired by anyone but the manufacturer as seen earlier the phone is displaying a message saying important display message clicking learn more takes you to apple's website there it says it's important that certified technicians who use genuine apple parts repair your phone no uncertified apple technician can purchase genuine parts and even if they used a used genuine part the message would still appear as each screen is paired to the phone therefore the phone isn't determining if the screen is a genuine part it only knows it's not the paired one further on they explain issues that can arise from low quality screens which for the most part is a fair statement however they also claim true tone doesn't function on a replacement screen this has nothing to do with the replacement screen itself but just apple disabling it when the screen is replaced and has a different serial number as for this iphone you can see true tone is working as it should as we reprogram the display earlier using the old screen serial numbers which makes this work from what i understand it appears apple can remove this message by updating something on the phone itself to pair the phone to the new display it also states in the fine print that the display not genuine message will only appear in the settings app after 15 days they also state it has no effect on the usability of the phone however as we saw earlier replacing the earpiece flex cable or face id cameras will disable face id with only apple being able to reprogram it at the end of the article it then tells me where i can go get service to fix my functioning phone how this works is quite simple the display's touch ic chip contains a unique identifier stored in secure memory that cannot be reprogrammed the only way to remove this message without paying apple to replace your screen would be to transfer this tiny little chip to the new screen requiring expensive equipment and a high risk of damaging your display the same issue arises with the battery in this phone which would display a similar message and disable apple's battery health readings i haven't replaced the battery in this phone as it's still at 96 percent health in my experience i've found they pair almost everything on the inside from pairing home buttons cameras light sensors vibration motors batteries and displays it's shocking to the lengths apple goes to prohibit diy repairs the issue with relying on the manufacturer for repairs is when they no longer offer a service for the device and no one else can fix it what are we supposed to do throw it out and buy a new one the recent lack of being able to repair our devices because of design or lockdowns is amounting to a mass increase of e-waste as for the phone everything is now working but it will always have a message in settings saying the display isn't genuine a bit of a shame given how modular the inside of iphones are but apple just refuses to let anyone repair their own phones which is such a shame and on that note this has been a huge jefferies video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration playlist for more videos just like this one and if you're looking for some tips or what tools i use to repair devices be sure to check out my website link for which is down in the

      "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to earthbeat we are going to replace the screen on this iphone 11 pro max the screen of this device is still responding despite having the glass and the screen panels broken the first step that we need to do is to remove two screws at the bottom of the device we can then use our suction cup to pull the screen out of the frame of the device you may be asking yourself this was really easy that's because the double-sided tape has been already removed out of the screen of this device it was repaired before even if this screen had the double-sided tape for water resistance we will still do the same thing in order to remove the screen out of the shell of the device the most serious stuff while doing this is to be careful around the right of the device on the right of the device we have the flex cable of the front speaker assembly all the flex cables are concentrated on the right of this device so that we do not need the flex cable of the screen but we still need the flex cable of the front speaker assembly after removing the retaining plate on the motherboard we still need to remove two screws that are holding the flex cable of the battery the flex cable of the battery is very important we need to disconnect that flex cable before we proceed on doing anything else the flexible of the battery out we can proceed into doing our screen replacement there is another flex cable coming from the battery at the bottom of the device near the taptic engine but you do not have to remove that in order to proceed next to remove the screen we need to disconnect three flex cables this is the new screen and the new double-sided tape you can attach the double-sided tape this way onto the device and then after installing the front speaker assembly we are going to reinstall everything onto the frame of the device after the removal of three screws we can start the removal process of the front speaker assembly look at what apple has done to this front speaker assembly the flex cables that they are using are very tiny and this is very fragile if you do not have too much experience you need to take your time in removing this front speaker assembly i started pulling on the front speaker assembly but it was not moving so i decided to add some heat to make everything go smoother because in case i break the front speaker assembly i'm not going to have face id on this device and that way the device will have lost 50 percent of its resale value so after slightly hitting the front of the screen for something like 5 to 10 seconds i started to pull again on the front speaker assembly and it was getting a little bit better but i still had the rectangular sensor on top of the screen stuck inside the bezel where it is sitting so while you're doing this part take your time if it takes you 10 minutes to do this do it in 10 minutes it's better than losing face id and having a device basically disabled the front speaker assembly is out now take a minute to inspect the front speaker assembly make sure that nothing has been damaged on it and then reinstall the front speaker assembly in the reverse order that you took it out of the screen of the device make sure that you install the double sided tape before you reinstall the front speaker assembly you can install the double-sided tape directly on the frame of the device or directly onto the new screen of this device in your case i advise you to put everything together but do not put the screws on and start testing the device to make sure the new screen is responding and you do not have any issues with the new screen that you just installed and everything is working like it should there is a notification on the screen this is apple notification to let you know that the screen that you just installed is not a good screen even if the screen came from apple you can bypass that notification and gain true tone back by programming the new screen to match with the new hardware i show you in my videos only everything that is necessary you can use your device this way with this notification on and the notification comes on only once the first time you turn the device after changing the screen after that you will never see that notification unless you go into setting and look for that notification but if you cannot live without true tone you will need to purchase a programmer that you're going to use once and hopefully get your true tone back thank you guys for watching subscribe like and share and i will see you on my next video click the one on the right",

      "transcript": "with every phone we make we're getting closer to a fairer more sustainable electronics industry one way we're doing that is by making phones that last longer it's all because of modularity the design lets you replace parts if they break and it's super easy want to learn more about using a fair phone and replacing its parts cool then this video is made for you let's begin every year consumers throw away millions of mobile phones that's because most phones aren't built to last and we're constantly encouraged to upgrade our devices this makes e-waste the world's fastest growing waste stream and that's why we've created a modular longer-lasting phone we care about what we're putting in our phones we track where our phone's parts come from and create demand for materials that are better for people and planet we're making an impact in material supply chains by sourcing more responsibly mine materials increasing our use of recycled materials and actively seeking partners who can help us achieve these goals okay enough talking how does the fairphone 3 plus work let's start at the beginning how do you open your fair phone the most important thing you'll need is a screwdriver it's included in the box with your phone the first step is to remove the protective case if you have one then take off the back cover by separating it from the frame make sure to start from the bottom right and carefully lift it until it's completely removed easy peasy right your battery consists of many materials but cobalt is one of the most important it's used to stabilize the battery store energy more efficiently and enable frequent charging but unfortunately cobalt mining is full of problems some of the issues include hazardous working conditions child labor and limited access to legitimate markets that's why we believe making fairer electronics means making fairer batteries for us the first part of that equation is more responsibly mined cobalt we're working directly at the mine sites to end child labor increase household incomes and last but not least invest in community programs designed to create sustainable livelihoods so when your fair phone battery doesn't work anymore you don't have to feel guilty about replacing it and the best thing about it is that it's super simple and really quick bet that we can show you how to replace a battery in ten seconds three two one go after you remove the protective case and back cover just lift out the battery from the white arrow at the bottom see told you so if you want people to call you you'll need to insert your sim card or skip this advice if you prefer a quiet life okay here we go after you remove the protective case and back cover just take out the battery insert the sim card and sd card following the arrows put the battery back in click the back cover into place and don't forget the protective case last but not least press and hold the power button to turn the phone on done did you know you can reduce emissions by 94 simply by replacing a broken screen instead of buying a new phone of course the most sustainable option is to not break your screen at all but we know stuff happens and replacing a screen can be expensive so most people don't bother with the fair phone it's easy to replace your screen after you remove the back cover and battery start removing the 13 screws holding the display module in place once all the screws are removed hold the phone with one hand place your fingers on the right side of the frame on the battery compartment now push the display out of the frame use one hand to hold the frame with the other keep lifting the display until it's fully removed repeat these steps backwards to put the phone back together again the camera these days it might seem like the most important part of your phone but what if it stops working or you want to upgrade there's no need for a new phone our camera module makes up just 5.5 of the total emissions so replacing the module and keeping your phone longer is the smart choice for you and the planet but how do you insert a new module first remove the protective case and back of the phone after that you can remove the battery the next step is to remove the 13 screws holding the display module in place once all screws are removed hold the phone with one hand place your fingers on the right side of the

      "title": "Google Pixel 3a Teardown! - Sufficiently Simple",
      "transcript": "The Pixel 3a is a practically perfect phone. A pinnacle of photographic prowess, with a\nvalue that predicates panic among more painfully priced phones. It's also phenomenally preferred among people\nwho like to pinch pennies and pay profoundly less. A prerequisite to purchasing though, is to\npolitely, pragmatically, and painstakingly pry open the Pixel to pinpoint any potential\npitfalls. Let's get started. The trick with opening up the Pixel 3a is\nto know where to put your pry tool. With a little bit of heat the screen comes\noff first, and will most likely break during this process...if it's not already broken. The safest of the unsafe places to start is\nup at the top, between the glass screen and the first plastic lip, since the fragile ribbon\ncables are down along the bottom of the phone. After the adhesive at the top is cut, I can\nwork my way down each side of the phone with a soft piece of paper or card stock, because\nif anything touches the display underneath that glass, it will shatter. It's a dangerous operation. Lastly, after getting a small gap, I can use\na bit more heat and carefully take the same piece of paper and slice through the adhesive\nholding the bottom portion to the screen. Then the whole thing can lift off, exposing\na single ribbon connector under this black piece of tape. The ribbon goes through the mid frame to the\nmotherboard underneath with only 2 t3 screws holding the little silver bracket over the\nsingle Lego style ribbon cable. This could very well be the easiest screen\nreplacement of 2019. With no other steps involved, it's a super\nsimple way to fix the most often broken component of a cell phone. Nice work, Google. The Pixel 3a is much more repairable than\nthe more expensive Pixel 3. There are 14 more of these same t3 screws\nholding down the mid plate. I'll link the tool kit I use down in the video\ndescription. The metal mid plate is probably what kept\nthe Pixel 3a from snapping in half during my durability test. Once the screws are gone, I can now pry into\nthe second gap between the black plastic lip and the purplish plastic of the phone. Then the whole thing pulls away from the phone\nbody with just the top front earpiece attached to it. We get our first glimpse at what looks like\na very complex inner workings of the Pixel 3a, but it's actually not that bad. Let me show you. The battery connector is underneath the side\nsqueeze sensor ribbon. I'll unplug that and then pop off the extension\nribbon, just like a little Lego, on both ends. Then I'll unplug the right side squeeze sensor,\nand the left side squeeze sensor. Does anyone actually use the squeeze sensing\nfunctionality? I kind of forgot they existed until now. There is good news about the battery though. It has magical pull tabs, signifying a very\neasy battery replacement...that is, of course, if you don't break the pull tabs like an amateur\nand have to commence the Pry of Shame. I, of course, would never break a pull tab\non accident. I only do it purely for educational purposes. The battery is a 3000 milliamp hour capacity\nand does allow replacement by dogs. You can see how the left over pull tab adhesive\npulls away from under the battery. See? Education. Next I'll unplug the side button ribbon cable\nand our little friend the headphone jack. The jack does have a little water damage indicator\non the bottom. This phone is not water resistant, so if it\ndoes get wet, the sticker will turn pink, avoiding any warranties. Underneath the motherboard we have one little\nribbon cable for the rear fingerprint scanner, and two wire cables that run down along the\nleft side. The motherboard houses a singular 12.2 megapixel\ncamera unit, which does include optical image stabilization. This is supposedly one of the best cellphone\ncameras on the market right now, but I'll let the other tech YouTubers compare the actual\nphoto quality. We're here for the hardware. The front camera is an 8 megapixel little\nguy with no optical image stabilization. No thermal paste or heat pipe on this plastic\ncontraption. Down here at the bottom we have 3 screws,\none on the board and the other two on the sides of the USB-C charging port. This crazy little board has the ribbon connector\nfor the charging port, and it's own white water damage indicator sticker and a microphone. The USB-C port has no rubber ring around the\ntip, but it is super simple and easy to replace. I'm a huge fan of the modularity on the Pixel\n3a. If you want a cheap, easy to fix phone, with\nfeatures like a headphone jack, this is a great option. The bottom loud speaker for some reason is\nvery securely attached to the plastic frame, but is pretty large and has it's own gold\ncontact pads to communicate with the motherboard. The last interesting thing to come out of\nthe Pixel 3a are the side squeeze sensors hidden below this long plastic rod for the\nelectronic buttons. The squeeze sensor is embedded into the side\nof the phone, and is made up of little resistors that are sensitive to being flexed...even\nsensing something as minor as a squeeze on both sides of the phone. This activates an app or a camera. Pretty crazy technology. Lastly, we have the neon power button. It's plastic protrusion is held in place by\na little black flap. Not as ingenious as the buttons on the Nintendo\nSwitch, but with the long black plastic rod holding it in place, I have no doubt it will\ndo it's job well. I It's been a few videos since I've put a phone\nback together in working condition. I've had to break open the OnePlus 7 Pro and\nRed Magic 3 to get access to the heat pipes under the screens. But this Pixel 3a should go back together\njust fine. Getting the fingerprint scanners and two side\nwires attached to the underside of the motherboard is pretty much the hardest part. Then the whole thing can flop over underneath\nit's little plastic latch, and I can situate the headphone jack back in it's slot. One screw holds down the motherboard, then\nthe extension ribbons, squeeze ribbons, and battery ribbon all get plugged back in. Then the mid plate can come down and hold\neverything securely and structurally in place with it's 14 screws. The easy to replace screen gets plugged in\nnext to the motherboard through that mid plate. A brand new screen would probably come with\nit's own adhesive, otherwise you can just use thin double sided tape. And that's it. A fully functional Pixel 3a. I'm a fan of where Google is headed with this\none. A phone that accomplishes all of the essentials\nwhile keeping money in your wallet. What do you think about the Pixel 3a? Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

      "title": "Repairing a &quot;Dumpster Dived&quot; Google Pixel 3a",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge jefferies video in this video i'm going to be repairing this google pixel 3a that someone threw out the pixel 3a is a cheaper model of google's pixel 3 smartphone featuring a plastic back the 3a is more durable than a glass-backed phone this one is badly cracked and doesn't light up when plugged in while i received this phone in a lot that i purchased on ebay for around 140 australian dollars it appears the seller had actually just pulled all of these phones from an e-waste bin how do i now know that well i called up the previous owner of this very google pixel and they told me what they did with it more on that later while the phone wasn't turning on using an amp meter i can see it's drawing about 1 amp of current when plugged in which indicates the phone is charging and likely just has a dead display but before we get started i'd like to thank my mates over at ifixit for sending in a replacement display for this phone if you're looking for some parts or one of their awesome tool kits i will leave a link down in the description to begin i'll place the google pixel onto my heat mat which will soften the adhesive on the display i left this for about five minutes before coming in with my eye slack suction cup tool to be able to separate the display this lifted so much easier than i was expecting as it's clear to me now that this is a replacement display panel the adhesive used has held the display in just fine although definitely isn't very hard to remove which for me is kind of a bonus and i'm really not sure what the original adhesive would have been like after running a plastic pick around the edge i was able to lift up the display panel and unscrew the two torx screws securing in place a metal bracket and the display cable after removing those and the display i'm able to remove any larger glass shards that remain on the frame this is also a good time to clean up the frame to remove as much of the old adhesive as possible from what i can tell the adhesive used to secure in the replacement display had just been applied over the original stuff which isn't the best practice so we're going to be taking as much of the adhesive off and trying to get it back to the bare plastic before applying our new adhesive i started by scraping away at the old adhesive using a plastic spudger i then came in with some alcohol to try and clean things up and get as much of that old adhesive removed as possible one thing to note is you're never going to get it absolutely perfect as long as you don't leave any big chunks that could leave the display not sitting entirely flush we should be good to go with our frame all ready to go it's time to crack out our replacement display from ifixit so we can actually test out the pixel 3a to see if it even works i'll start by connecting the display cable back onto the phone and i'll simply press and hold the power button you can see it briefly shows the battery low symbol so i'm going to plug in the usbc cable and let it charge up a little bit before we power it on booting up the phone it launched right into a lock screen and is passcode locked with there being contact info i gave them a call to ensure it wasn't a lost phone and this is what they said um you've gotten a pixel and it's got my in case of emergency details on it gave it to the spot um office work kind of thing i think so i'm just gonna reset it is there anything you need to uh back up if you could just reset it for me that would be really good from the call we learned the last owner tossed it into an e-waste bin at officeworks a stationary store in australia it's likely an employee has dumps to dive through saved a bunch of phones and is selling them on ebay honestly i'm happy he did so because all of the phones except one in that initial lot showed signs of life it's really amazing what people throw out now that we know the phone works i'm going to honor the request of the previous owner and wipe all of the data off of the phone it's now locked with a pin code whilst we wait for their response i'm going to remove the display panel we just installed so i can apply some fresh adhesive so we can get the display panel permanently installed into the phone for this you can use a pre-cut set or try to make something yourself which is what i'll be doing in my case as i'd lost the pre-cut adhesive for this model i'll be using adhesive cut off a roll for the top and bottom sections with liquid adhesive on the sides as i don't have any tape thin enough to cover those sides given that the liquid adhesive is messy and sets really fast i will attach the display first reinstalling its bracket and two screws afterwards i can remove all the protective film from the adhesive we just installed as well as from the back of the display panel and now i can apply the liquid adhesive for this i'm using something called e-8000 what does that stand for i've got no idea i've only ever used this adhesive once but it worked and did a really good job with it applied i can firmly press into place our google pixel display hoping that everything will stay put as you can see the sides of the phone are completely loose and the adhesive definitely didn't work so i'll need to open up the display and apply some more adhesive i believe i may have just taken too long to apply the adhesive and get the display panel seated correctly or maybe i just didn't add enough either way though i'll need to do this a second time for this i'll actually be using b7000 where are they coming up with these names i have no idea it's exactly the same stuff it even smells just as toxic this time around though i'll apply a little bit more than i did last time and try and be a little bit quicker with my application after pressing the display panel into place i set a whole box of phones on top to apply pressure while the glue was drying about 30 minutes later i removed it and cleaned off the excess from the side of the phone and this time around you can see there is no play in the side of the phone and everything is sitting nice and flush the last thing we need to do is test out our phone and get it up and running after some messing around i got the phone actually activated and got it past the pin lock screen after setting up the phone you can see everything has been reset and we have a working google pixel 3 on android 10. the last thing that's left to do is to give this phone a really good clean the most dirtiest and grimiest part of this phone was actually the speaker grills and they were absolutely caked with dirt and grime using some alcohol and a toothbrush i could clean those up as well as the usbc connector i also gave the back of the phone a good wipe down and of course remove the plastic protective film and we're done so this is it a phone that was once so close to being broken down into its core elements and being recycled was saved and repaired into a working condition this phone was still being sold by google when i got a hold of it so it couldn't have been used for all that long to reiterate on what i said earlier it's amazing what people throw out because they think it's not fixable or they think no one wants it i believe a lot of e-waste turns out to actually be things other people could have used or have fixed which is such a shame and on that note this has been a huge jefferies video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration playlist for

here we go probably using my nail we're gonna take this thing out and then you're gonna see two screws put this here somewhere screw right there and you get your Torx screwdriver so it looks like it's a smaller dick yeah that works so this one is a if I can read it t4 it says t4 a t4 screw tip screwdriver so do that it's only two screws ooh thing came out easy I barely even touched it and it came out okay so from this point we're just gonna go ahead and just test the screen so the customer brought this phone in the screen was just completely dead and the screen didn't even turn on at all so well let's see there we go I mean well we're almost done right so let's just uh so I've been showing some easy phones lately like what is it the LG style of for that phones easy to fix you guys just saw this thing as easy to fix the Google pixel three Axl this phone just came out two months ago it's still like a brand new phone okay here we go it's still booting up screen works perfectly fine so let's turn the power off power off shutting down so pretty much all we have to do now is reglue you're not really using glue you're re you're putting adhesive - uh I don't want you guys to use glue like none of this none of this crap dude don't use glue nothing all right so now we're gonna unhook this and once again it unhooked easy I like barely even touched it and unhook okay so what I'm gonna do now is get all these little shards of glass right here that are still left there so you see how there's broken glass up here and there's some adhesive that needs to get cleaned out here so I'm gonna do that now all right so now that we have all the old adhesive removed and all the little itty-bitty shards of glass taken out of here and it's all cleaned up so now we have to re attach this new stream back into the phone and since this phone I could not find any pre-cut adhesive for this phone so like for example this is pre-cut adhesive for the Galax not the galaxy for the pixel 2xl so if this was a 2 XL you would get a pre-cut adhesive like this you would stick it in the phone like this and you can attach it a lot simpler and easier with pre-cut adhesive I always buy pre-cut adhesive I use it on all the Samsung phones it's so much easier to do it with this but I could not find it anywhere probably because this phone is too new so they don't even make it yet so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use this and hopefully the next time or whenever a customer brings in or they need their three Axl phone fixed I'll have pre-cut adhesive to use my game plan is I'm gonna use this 3m double-sided adhesive and I'll just show you guys so we're gonna need a razor blade so I think I'm gonna do it this way I'm just gonna put tape over everything and then the little cutouts I'm just gonna use like a razor blade around the camera so it can cut out and cut around the sensor and we'll see if that how that looks all right so that's pretty much how I put the adhesive and as you guys can tell I haven't did my cutouts yet so but I marked where the camera is in the proximity sensor is over here so I'm gonna do those little cut-offs right now see you guys can take a quick look this actually turned out pretty good as you can see some of the adhesive is still there on the top see right there where I'm and then I'll just start taking this stuff off and that and that and then this and then this thing should go like that and then this out this I'll take that out this out in there and one left on the top corner all right so this adhesive once again this is 3m double-sided adhesive so now we need to plug in this phone one thing I forgot to tell you guys is you guys okay you see this little ear speaker mesh right there you have to remove it from the old one so you remove that little ear speaker mesh and you you put it here as a new screen doesn't have it so okay so now we're gonna get this and we're gonna screw this down all right so we're gonna turn the phone on to see how everything looks okay so that's going on I don't really know if you even need this thing but I'm gonna stick it back anyways probably don't even need this there you go and then this thing should fit right back in you line it up just like that oops you gotta take this off that was underneath the screen okay it was on the it was on the bottom side of the screen so go like that line it up with your fingers like that fits right in there so I'm squeezing it there we go we are good to go with this so that is the pixel 3a Excel well that was easy wasn't it okay so before I go I'm gonna try something new with you guys okay so if anybody out there wants their Instagram name or their YouTube channel name shout it out in my next video right your Instagram or your YouTube channel in the comments below and on the next video I'm gonna shout somebody out I've never done this before so I don't even know what the response is gonna be so just write them in the comments below and on my next video I'm gonna shout somebody out in the video alright so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys on the next video peace",

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, welcome back to geardo. Today we will   show you how to replace the Front \ncamera on the google pixel 3a phone. To start, we need to have the right \ntools to proceed with the repair,   which You can find in the description. At first, turn off the phone,   take out the sim tray, and then remove \nthe LCD screen removal from the front. To remove the LCD, we are using a heating pad. \nPlace the front screen side on the heating pad,   select the mobile phone HEATING option, and leave \nit till it completes. Alternatively, you can   use a heat gun or hairdryer around the screen \nedges until the pasted adhesive becomes soft. Once you feel the Heating is enough, use a \nsuction cup to lift the screen and then insert   a plastic card pry tool or something similar \nto cut the adhesive around the LCD screen. Lift the screen gradually and disconnect the \nconnector plug by undoing two screws and removing   the metal shield. There is an adhesive strip \non top of the connector. It is missing from   this device. If you have the sticky, peel it \noff and place it while connecting the new lcd. Next, take out the mid-frame plate by undoing \nfourteen screws. And then, by using a plastic   card pry tool or triangle picker, move around \nthe phone to release the mid frame's clips. Next, lift the mid-frame by the bottom, rise to \n45% degrees, and release the proximity sensor.   And then take out the frame. Next on the body, disconnect the \nbattery connector and followed by   disconnecting five more connectors in the board. Next, to take out the logic board, loosen the \nscrew and gently lift by using a pry tool. Next, gently turn over the logic board and take   out the broken front camera \nby disconnecting the plug. Next, replaced the broken front camera \nwith a unit and placed it on the board. Next, place the logic board on the \nbody and secure it by adding the screw. Next, secure five plugs and the \nbattery plug to the logic board. Next, Connect the proximity sensor and place \nthe midframe by adding fourteen screws.   Here, we take out the frame's proximity \nsensor and then connect it to the logic board. When placing the mid-frame, gently pick the sensor \nthrough the opening and put it in the frame.  We are doing this to eliminate the difficulty of   clicking the sensor plug into the \nboard while installing the frame. Next, place the lcd screen on the body. \nAnd then, connect the lcd plug and add the   shield by inserting two screws. And also \nthe Tape which we don't have but you may. Before installing the LCD Screen, \nensure it has enough glue on it;   if not, use B7000 glue or a \nnew double-sided LCD adhesive. Finally, we are adding bonding clips to tighten \nthe LCD screen with the body. Leave it for some   time and remove it. On the other hand, you can \nuse rubber bands and leave them for some time. I hope you have enjoyed the replacement guide. Let us know if you have any questions. Please, \nlike, share, and comment on our videos. DO not forget to hit the subscribe button.",

To start, we need to have the right tools\nto proceed with the repair, which You can find in the description. At first, turn off the phone and remove the\nLCD screen removal from the front. To remove the screen,\nit needs to heat gently around the screen edges until the pasted adhesive becomes soft. For this, we are using a heat gun. Alternatively, you can use a heat pad or hairdryer\naround the screen edges until the pasted adhesive becomes soft. Carefully work around on edges, and Once you\nfeel the heating is enough, use a suction cup to lift the LCD Screen. In between, Insert a Plastic Card pry tool\nand gently cut the adhesive around. Lift the screen gradually and disconnect the\nconnector plug by undoing two screws and removing the metal shield. There is an adhesive strip on top of the connector. It is missing from this device. If you have the sticky, peel it off and place\nit while connecting the new lcd. Next, take out the mid-frame plate by undoing\nfifteen screws. And then, by using a plastic card pry tool\nor triangle picker, move around the phone to release the mid frame clips. Next on the body, first, remove the sim tray. And then disconnect the battery connector\nand followed by disconnecting six more connectors in the board. Next, loosen the screw and take out the long\nbracket on the right edge. To take out the Rear camera, you do not need\nto take out the logic board or loosen all connections. Next, gently turn over the logic board and\ntake out the broken front camera by disconnecting the plug. Next, replace the broken front or rear camera\nwith a new unit and place it on the board. Next, place the logic board on the body and\nsecure it by adding the screw. Next, secure six plugs into the board, including\nthe bracket. And also, connect the battery plug to the\nlogic board. Next, place the midframe by adding fifteen\nscrews. Next, place the lcd screen on the body. And then, connect the lcd plug and add the\nshield by inserting two screws. And also the Tape which we don't have but\nyou may. Before installing the LCD Screen, ensure it\nhas enough glue on it; if not, use B7000 glue or a new double-sided LCD adhesive. Finally, we are adding bonding clips to tighten\nthe LCD screen with the body. Leave it for some time and remove it. On the other hand, you can use rubber bands\nand leave them for some time.

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Fold Teardown! - How does it even work?",
      "transcript": "today we're going to take apart the galaxy fold this is the phone from samsung that opens up to show off a full internal display tucked inside the two halves since my inner screen was damaged during the durability test and is a bit finicky now my question is can i disassemble the phone and just keep one half of it as a functional device because technically there is that one screen that still works on the outside it should be an interesting little experiment let's get started so there are three surfaces to this phone the large square inner screen and then the two long rectangles that are located on the outside samsung phones are typically taken apart by removing the back glass and this galaxy fold appears to be no different with a bit of heat from my hika and a bit of fancy finessing from my razor blade along with the suction cup i can gently work my way around the back glass panel slicing through the adhesive it's a tad difficult since the glass is curved but not impossible after the majority of the adhesive is cut i can twist off the only piece of this phone that doesn't have a screen attached and pull it away from the phone there are no ribbons or anything sensitive attached to the underside of the glass we do get our first look at the wireless charging coil which i totally forgot this phone even had now we have two sides left i'm going to assume that this phone has more components under the smaller display so i'll grab my suction cup heat gun and razor blade and work my way around the glass once again taking special care not to put my razor blade too deep into the phone because if the screen gets poked from the underside it'll be dead the screens are very fragile as we learned from the folding screen inside of this phone after the adhesive is warmed up and cut away i can tilt the screen up and away from the hinge side folding it open allowing access to the thin ribbon cable plugged in underneath the black plastic cap once i unsnap that like a little lego the front screen and glass panel can be removed it's a super thin compact little design oled screens are as thin as they come it's the same style of screen we saw in the back of the nuvia x and now we know that samsung can do dual screens maybe they'll start adding front and rear screens to their other phones just because they can no complaints here there are 19 visible screws holding down the internal back plastics to the phone and three more screws hidden underneath the wireless charging flap after those are removed the wireless charging can be pulled away this has the circular wireless coils in the center along with what looks like nfc coils all of which can communicate through the gold contact pads that rest up against the motherboard now i can remove the black plastics from the right side the top section has a built-in loudspeaker along with a separate earpiece speaker kind of interesting that they are both right next to each other then we have a plain black piece of plastic that brackets around the battery and lastly we have the bottom plastics which contain the loudspeaker one cool thing about this little speaker just like we saw inside the iphone 11 pro are these little white foam dots that fill up the space inside of the speaker box the lightweight specs are added to the speaker housing to dampen the speaker as the speaker moves air inside of the speaker box has to pass through the foamy dots causing the air to scatter and act less dense which then allows the speaker to sound bigger than it actually is people have been adding foam to subwoofer boxes for years so it's interesting to see the same concept applied here on this subwoofer for ants someone should count these for us you might have noticed already that this phone has two batteries inside a smaller little guy off to the left and then a relatively proportional battery on the right side i'll unplug each of them just like little legos removing the battery is the same dangerous tedious process that it always is with samsung's even on this futuristic galaxy bold samsung still hasn't updated their battery adhesion practices with two pry tools gently leveraging up the battery i can finally remove it by hand but any accidental bins would either cause the battery to just slowly expand over the next several months or explode immediately it's a fun little game that keeps you on your toes i'll remove the extension ribbon over top of the smaller little battery and then commence the same gentle prying procedure while hoping nothing spontaneously combusts the small battery is a milliamp hour and the larger is a 2135 for a combined total of 4235 milliamp hours something i haven't noticed before is that both of the motherboards inside the galaxy fold kind of glimmer with a rainbow effect like a gasoline drip in a wet parking lot it must be some kind of treatment that they use while assembling the boards it looks super cool i really do think that sometimes the insides of cell phones look cooler than the outsides thumbs up to samsung for that one speaking of internals here's a close-up shot of the guts for those of you with a galaxy fold you can screenshot this crop it and make it a wallpaper back to business it's time to see how this hinge works and how it was able to withstand my bin test the sim card tray does have a rubber ring around the lip but there's definitely no ingress protection rating on this phone since dust can still very easily get inside at other points i'll remove the three large ribbon connectors on this half of the motherboard remember that this is also the half of the phone that the smaller rear screen plugs into there's one more phillips head screw holding the motherboard down and then i can lift up and unlatch the last little ribbon on the underside before pulling the motherboard free the shimmery motherboard comes out with the outer camera still connected it's a 10 megapixel camera with no optical image stabilization there's also a large magnet along the side and up in the corners this helps keep the phone closed but it's pretty well balanced without being too strong or noticeable i'll unsnap the two large motherboard extension ribbons from the other half of the phone along with the side button connector and i can pop out the two internal front-facing cameras remember there are six cameras in here these little guys are the 10 megapixel main camera along with its 8 megapixel depth sensing sidekick neither of which have optical image stabilization after popping off the two bottom signal wires the motherboard can start lifting away from inside the phone and once it's out we get our first glimpse of the copper cooling pad underneath the board the motherboard doesn't have any thermal paste but it does have the foam pad to help transfer heat the triple camera setup on the galaxy fold is very similar to the galaxy note 10 with its 12 megapixel two times optical zoom camera down at the bottom then the 12 megapixel main camera here in the center that also has optical image stabilization the main camera also has the little variable aperture gizmo it can magnetically adjust how much light can enter the sensor with its little circular shutter thingies pretty cool the 12 megapixel wide angle camera up top does not have any optical image stabilization remember how i was going to take this phone apart and see if half of the fold could still function as a full phone well both sides do have a battery and one half has an extra screen so it was a good theory but the problem is the small screen is on the opposite side of the usb-c charging port so the galaxy fold definitely needs both halves of the phone to still function who would have thought the copper vapor chamber can pry out of the phone easy enough this little guy just dissipates the heat from the processor allowing the phone to run a little cooler we've seen this kind of copper inside of a lot of phones at this point so let's keep going it's time to check out the massive internal 7.3 inch amoled screen and the complex hinge contraption that holds this whole thing together now you probably remember that this is the second time the galaxy fold has been released the first time it launched there was what looked like a screen protector on top but was actually part of the screen itself samsung has since extended that screen protector looking plastic component of the screen up underneath this plastic bezel so people now won't be tempted to peel it off my temptation to peel the screen off though is still pretty strong so let's proceed the screen is paper thin this time and well you know it's foldable it feels like a giant piece of thick packing tape just peeling away from the phone body and it's rather satisfying samsung has added a metal plate under each half of the phone on this new version and this is supposed to add a little bit of structure to the screen at the same time while not allowing any dust to get behind the display to cause damage since the phone body is not dust proof samsung has said that anyone with a samsung fold can replace that inner folding screen during the first year for a one-time fee of 149. which seems more than reasonable but if you happen to break the screen more than once or after that first year it'll be 599 funny how samsung can replace the whole screen for the same price that apple's charging to swap the back glass of an iphone 11. now let's take an up close and personal look at this hinge this floppy boy survived my durability test and i think it's time we found out how and why there are some pieces of long thin black tape covering up the internal screws i'll pull those away from the galaxy fold so we can see more of the impressive engineering we can also see some of the sand that slipped up inside the fold this is still causing a grinding noise as the phone opens and closes let's take things a step further the hinge of the galaxy fold is made up of three main components the first of which being the massive back metal spine of the fold and it's held in place by ten screws once those are removed the spine can be pulled from the center of the phone its metal design has chambers or ridges inside to help guide the other components of the hinge it keeps them from bending too far or rotating out of place here in the center we see the inner gears inspired by watch mechanics along with three of the four spring-loaded clasps that lock the fold into the open position it feels extremely well balanced inside of the fold we get these metal interlocked shovel looking gizmos two large ones in the center with two more smaller versions of both the top and the bottom there are a lot of moving parts inside of this thing which does make it feel very balanced and natural while also being incredibly sturdy but with all the precision that these moving parts require there's not very much room for any specks of sand and currently sand and dust can still get inside and grind away to their little heart's content so while this hinge design was inspired by watch mechanics hopefully samsung can also seal it up like watches are in future versions of the fold i think it's an awesome innovation and it's good of samsung to take care of their customers by offering replacement screens for so cheap during that first year i look forward to seeing what other versions of the folds come out next personally i want to see a smaller fold that opens vertically into a normal size cell phone kind of like the old school flip phones it'll be fun to see what happens do you think folding phones are ever going to catch on and be mainstream let me know down in the comments hit that subscribe button if you haven't already and coming out me on instagram and twitter thanks for watching i'll see you around",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Fold 5 Teardown | Disassembly &amp; Repair Guide",
      "transcript": "what's up guys welcome back to Tech depth teardown today we are going to be tearing down a Samsung Galaxy fold 5 the new Samsung fold and we also have a Galaxy fold 4 on hand so we are going to do a little side by side of the two of them see what differences we can see and the truth is there aren't too many differences from a hardware perspective these are very similar phones but ultimately one of the small differences is actually quite a big difference and you can see it right there that is that hinge and of course with a foldable phone like this the engine is a big deal and this hinge sits a lot flatter it is a more simple mechanism so it is less likely to have durability issues although almost certainly there will be some dust getting into that hinge and you can hope that it's going to be small pieces of dust but there's going to be dust so you see those cameras those cameras are I believe identical I think it's totally identical Hardware uh 12 megapixel wide angle the 50 megapixel Main and then the 10 megapixel telephoto lens that 30X optical zoom there you can see the hinge again and it's a big difference I mean when when the phone sits that much flatter and the phone is marketed entirely around being a foldable it's nice you know I also really like that matte finish on the new fold I think it looks pretty cool to tell you the truth obviously the full four we have is a little scuffed up so maybe that's influencing how I feel about it but I think that all in all aesthetically the fold five is a big Improvement and if that hinge really does have better durability than the fold four then that's good but this phone is rated ipx8 not ip68 so it has not been tested for dust Ingress and everything I've seen is that the hinge is certainly going to let Dustin and that makes sense I mean it's probably really hard to keep dust out of that and as long as it's not giant pieces of particulate matter then hopefully it shouldn't affect the sound or the function of that hinge in a perfect world anyways so right now we're doing what we can to get that front that 6.2 inch cover glass off without harming any of the cables so that's why you see that roller we don't use the roller too often but for this one we decided it was worth it the suction cup is also key and the the screen actually comes down vertically as you can now see and there is a flex cable attached to it that we are going to deal with and then the screen will be free there we go it's a good looking phone for sure I think the internals look really nice really clean and right there you can see that the screen is really not too dissimilar from the fold four it's more or less identical so next we are going to be working on getting into that back glass which we're going to apply some heat the isopropyl alcohol that we have on hand it helps a little but with these phones the isopropyl really does not help nearly as much as the iPhone a lot of other products so really it's just a lot of gentle smudging taking your time being patient and with that you will get your first look at the inside of that back panel yeah we can see those cameras some more glue 5G Wireless and of course one of the nice things about this phone as compared to the iPhone or even some other products of course apple is really famous for it but you're only going to be using that Phillips head screwdriver so I think we have 23 screws I'll give it a count and give you the correct number in the editing room but I believe it's 23 screws and the fact that they're all one screwdriver is really nice so now we get to working on those Flex cables the plastic face plates and there is our wireless charging coil as well as the NFC and next we're going to be getting acquainted with the flex cables that connect to the motherboard motherboard is equipped with a new Snapdragon chip which is pretty nice same as the flip 5 I do believe and you can see it's kind of fun those cameras are interlinked you need to be really precise with cameras especially when you have three of them in order to make sure that as things flip between software and Hardware uh everything is where it needs to be and there is that main Flex cable that connects the motherboard to the daughter board I actually think it's called a sub PBA uh with that type c Port I think they call that the sub PBA there is our 5G antenna mm wave and now we can get to work on the screws that have been revealed by that plastic face plate being removed and take out the motherboard and the cameras come with it so like I said the top is that 12 megapixel Ultra wide then you of course have the main and we're going to disconnect them all so you can see them anyways but they're connected to the motherboard with those Flex cables and as soon as you detach the flex cables they come with you of course the front-facing camera is still there but easy to deal with that's the main 50 megapixel camera that is the 10 megapixel telephoto and now we can get to work on that I'm pretty certain it's called the sub PBA board and the type C Port has that little rubber gasket to help with water protection and I do believe that the main phone is indeed dust protected I just think that they get the X in the rating because the hinge has not been tested and there's another plastic face plate that is covering the daughter board and the other uh selfie camera as well and of course you can see that things are packed pretty tightly which means there is no room for the S Pen the new S Pen is 40 thinner I believe that was the number that I heard thrown around but it still doesn't fit unfortunately there's not quite enough room for it so if you do want to use that S Pen and you want to keep it handy you're going to need to get the outside attachment there's that daughter board and our goal was really to do this tear down without breaking any components so that is it for us we didn't want to touch that gorilla glass the flexible glass because it's really hard to remove without breaking and you can see the battery has that nice pull tab and that is going to be it so if you guys enjoyed that video please check us out at

      "title": "Take Apart &amp; Replace Screen - Samsung Galaxy S10 Screen Repair",
      "transcript": "hey there what's up everyone hope you're doing great today in this video I want to show you how to take apart to replace the OLED and glass screen assembly on your samsung galaxy s 10 so if you're watching this video chances are you probably cracked your glass or OLED display on your samsung galaxy s 10 and in this video I'm going to be showing you how to take it apart to replace it so let's go ahead and get right into it first off let's go ahead and power the device off next up we're gonna remove the sim and SD card tray up here at the top so push in a sim ejector tool and remove the tray so next up we're gonna need to heat up the back cover of the phone so we can do this with a hairdryer or a heat gun we're gonna give it heat around the edges it's gonna have some adhesive there that's holding it in place so give it heat and continue to move around so that you don't burn the phone in one spot you can also set it on a hot plate which is what I prefer to use I set it to a hundred degrees Celsius and leave it on there for a couple minutes and here are some of the tools that we will be using for this repair so we'll be using this a plastic card we'll be using a suction cup we'll be using a small Phillips head screwdriver we'll be using some plastic prying tools like this one and this green one and we'll be using some rubber gloves to protect us from the heat so that we don't burn our hands when holding the hot phone so remember we're gonna have a link down below in the description for all of the parts and tools used for this repair so once the phone is hot enough let's go ahead and grab it we're gonna get the suction cup and we're gonna place it towards the bottom where the charger port is on the back cover and then we're gonna lift up gently on the suction cup until we see a slight opening in between the glass and the frame of the phone as we can already see here there's already a slight opening so we're gonna go ahead and grab one of the thin prying tools to wedge it in there and hold it open so this card is perfectly because it's super thin so we can just squeeze in there very gently and it will go in very easily and then we're moving around just to release the adhesive that's holding the glass to the frame we can also use the help of a second plastic prying tool we can wedge it in there and it will help to maintain the back cover open and the next we're gonna go down one of the sides of the phone entirely with the plastic card we can now remove the suction cup and then we'll just gently continue to go down the side here with this card removing all of the adhesive that's holding the sides together here it is recommended to use a plastic prying tool or a card like this so that you don't damage anything inside the phone once we slide it all the way down we can wedge another prying tool in here to keep it open and then we're gonna work our way down the other side of the back cover with the card so that we can remove the adhesive that's on this side don't rush yourself just take your time and go down little gently so you don't crack the back glass also you don't want to stick anything in there too much because you can damage the wireless charging cable and also internal parts of the phone if you feel that the adhesive is getting hard to remove go ahead and heat the phone up for a little bit longer and it will help loosen the adhesive to continue removing the rest of it all right so it is gonna have some adhesive also left over here at the top so let's go ahead and finish removing what's left of the adhesive here at the top of the phone so go ahead and lift up from the bottom of the back glass here just finished releasing any leftover adhesive that might still be holding the back cover onto the frame you might see some pieces of adhesive here that are still stuck so just go in there and individually separate the pieces that are still holding it together so once most of the adhesive is removed we can go ahead and wiggle the back cover around from side to side I might still have some adhesive left over here at the top here has some in this top corner here so I'm going to go ahead and remove it with this plastic card you can wedge it in there and move it around until the adhesive is completely released there you go once it is you can go ahead and lift up on the back cover we'll come out completely in one piece so another thing is inspect and realign the adhesive onto the back cover so that it's ready when it's time to reinstall the back cover so next step is with a small Phillips head screwdriver we're going to be removing 15 small Phillips head screws that are holding the back parts of the phone to its frame so once all of the Phillips head screws are removed we're going to be removing the back pieces here of the phone we're gonna be using the plastic prying tool and we're gonna wedge under the wireless charger cable here it's gonna be glued down to the bottom speaker so we're gonna wedge under it gently and remove the adhesive by sliding it in there and lifting up on it gently then we can use the prying tool to lift up on the plastic portion of the back piece and the clips will be released and it will come off very easily in one piece next up is the bottom portion here this is the loudspeaker so we can just gently pry up on it with the plastic prying tool give it some pressure prying it up slowly and gently so that you don't crack it and once it releases all the clips it will come off easily as well so here we have the guts of the samsung galaxy s 10 here is the motherboard and all of the parts on the motherboard so let's go ahead and disconnect the battery cable first just to make sure there's no electricity flowing through the phone and next up let's go ahead and disconnect this cable right here which this is the cable for the screen that transmits the touch and the display for the lid now we're gonna have to remove three more small Phillips head screws one here at the top by the cameras and two at the bottom by the charging port let's go ahead and disconnect this flex cable here for the top front camera and let's disconnect the small flex cable down here for the headphone jack once that's all removed we can go ahead and pry up gently on the motherboard from the top here pull it up gently you might have to remove the battery cable out of the way and then you can lift the entire motherboard and it will come out completely if what you want to replace is just your LCD and glass screen assembly this is the cable right here that connects to it so all we would have to do next is heat up the entire front portion of the screen the entire front screen assembly you can give it heat with either a hairdryer or a heat gun by moving it or on the screen or you can also lay it on the hot plate which is what I use and then what's it's hot enough we're gonna get a prying tool like this it could be a metal one we're gonna give it a pressure here in between the glass and the frame of the phone we're gonna go around the entire screen assembly just pulling it up and obviously it's not gonna matter if you break your screen because it's already broken so we're gonna just completely remove the entire screen and then we would place the new screen right here where the old one is and we will slide the cable in through a little opening right here or the flex cable although you can also change the entire assembly of the phone which will come with the OLED panel the glass and the housing frame of the phone so will come just like this and we'll just need to remove and reinstall the small parts left on here on the new frame so let's go ahead and do that now so let's go ahead and remove to the headphone jack if you pry it up gently it will come off pretty easily then next let's remove the vibrator motor with a thin solid prying tool you can squeeze it in there and it will come up pretty easily as well and then next we'll also have to remove the ear speaker we can pry that up with the prying tool try and wedge it under it and then gently just give it some pressure upwards and it will come out and there you go there is your ear speaker so next up we need to remove the battery as well so you may want to give it some heat you'll do this on the front screen assembly of the phone once again with a hairdryer heat gun or you can lay it on a hot plate and then once it's hot enough and the adhesive holding the battery loosens up you can go ahead and just pry up on the battery with a plastic prying tool don't use a metal prying tool because you can cause the battery to blow up and the battery should come out pretty easily once you have everything removed then you'll just have the frame of the phone which will look like this it comes with the OLED panel the glass and the metal housing frame of the phone you can order this entire piece as well which will come just like this and then all you'll have to do is put everything back together in reverse order and we'll have links down below in the description to where you can get all the parts and tools used for this repair and then just make sure that the adhesive on your back cover is aligned correctly so that we can go back to the frame of the phone so go ahead and position the back cover to the back of the phone go ahead and position the top corner first once you have that in there align correctly then we can go ahead and place the rest of it down to the frame of the phone and then just make sure everything is aligned properly and then we're gonna go ahead and squeeze on all sides of this back glass go around all of the edges giving it pressure and squeezing them firmly together so that the adhesive can do its job and glue back on to the phone button place your SIM card tray back in and then you're ready to power your phone back on so that you can test it out alright everyone so that was just a quick video helping you take apart to replace the OLED and glass screen assembly on your samsung galaxy s 10 if this video helped you out go ahead and give it a like and that is it for now I will see you guys in the next video

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, Welcome back to geardo, Today we will show you how to replace the lcd \nscreen on the Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile phone.\n   To start, we need to have the right \ntools to proceed with the repair,   which You can find in the description. First, Take out the Sim tray \nand then the back cover removal. To remove the back cover, it needs to heat gently   around the rear cover edges until \nthe pasted adhesive becomes soft. For this, we are using a heating pad. Place \nthe back cover side on the heating pad,   select the mobile phone HEATING \noption, and leave it till   it completes. Alternatively, you \ncan use a heat gun or hairdryer. Once the heating has completed,   Use a suction cup to create an opening \nbetween the frame and rear cover. Next,   insert a plastic card pry tool or something \nsimilar to cut the adhesive around the back cover. Take out the back cover, and Next,   Take out the board frame with the \nwireless coil by undoing eight screws. And also, unplug the battery connector. Next, move to the bottom and take out \nthe bracket by undoing seven screws. Next, take out the headphone \njack by unplugging the connector. Next, disconnect the LCD connector. Next, On the top left, disconnect and \ntake out the front camera from the board. Next, Take out the logic \nboard by undoing three screws,   one on the top and two around the charger \nport. And then, gently lift the board slowly. Next, apply little heat and \ntake out the vibrator motor. Next, apply little heat and take out the earpiece. Next, take out the battery. First, apply little to soften the glue on the \nbattery. For this, we are using a heat gun.   Once you feel the heating is enough, use a card \npry tool to cut the adhesive under the battery.   And Once you have some space, use \na pry tool to lift the battery. Now the only remaining part is the broken front \nscreen assembly with the frame and buttons. For the replacement, there are a few \ndifferent screen types in the market.   The most common is the Original service pack \nscreen, which comes with the frame and buttons.   There is another type, it is original \nbut without the frame. But the repair job   is a little bit difficult and time-consuming, \nand the price difference is not that big. And   also, there are refurbished & used \nscreens with the frame and without. I would recommend you to go with a screen with \nthe frame & buttons installed. It can be original,   refurbished, or used. And this type \nis commonly available to purchase. Next, on the new screen frame, \nstart placing removed parts. Next, move to the bottom and first \nplace the vibrator motor on the frame. Next, Place the earpiece. Next, place the logic board \nand secure three screws. Next, Place the battery with adhesive. Next, secure the headphone jack. Next, secure the sim tray and front camera. Next, place the bottom bracket \nby adding seven screws. Next, secure the battery connector. Next, place the board frame with the \nwireless coil by adding eight screws.\n   Finally, Before installing the main back cover,   make sure it has enough glue on it. If \nnot, use B7000 glue or a new double-sided   back cover adhesive. I   hope you have enjoyed the \nscreen replacement guide. Let us know if you have any questions; \nplease share and comment on our videos. DO not forget to hit the subscribe button.\n \n ",

      "summary": "hey there what's up everyone in this video I'm going to show how to take apart to replace the battery on your samsung galaxy s 10. If you're watching this video chances are your battery is probably turning off on you or draining too fast. In this video we're gonna show you how to remove the sim and SD card tray up here at the top. the tools that we will be using for this repair so we'll be using this a plastic card we'll be using a suction cup we will be using a small Phillips head screwdriver. We'll  be using some rubber gloves to protect us from the heat so that we don't burn our hands when holding the hot phone. Remember we're gonna have a link down below in the description for all of the parts and tools used for this Repair. squeeze it in there very gently and it will go in very easily and then we're moving around just to release the adhesive that's holding the glass to the frame. Once we slide it all the way down we can wedge another prying tool in here to keep it open. don't want to stick anything in there too much because you can damage the wireless charging cable and also internal parts of the phone if you feel that the adhesive is getting hard to remove go ahead and heat the phone up for a little bit longer and it will help loosen the adhesive. gonna go ahead and remove it with this plastic card you can wedge it in there and move it around until the adhesive is completely released there you go once it is you can go ahead to lift up on the back cover and it will come out completely in one piece so another thing is inspect a realigned the adhesive onto the back Cover so that it's ready when it's time to reinstall the phone. The guts of the samsung galaxy s 10 here is the motherboard and all of the parts on the motherboard. Let's go ahead and disconnect the battery cable first just to make sure there's no electricity flowing through the phone and next we're gonna be removing the battery. We're gonna heat up the front screen of the phone with either a hairdryer or heat gun. use a metal prying tool because they can make the battery blow up so we're gonna squeeze the plastic pry tool gently and carefully in between the frame of the phone here and the battery. Once the adhesive is loose you can go ahead and just grab the battery with your fingers and pull it out. go ahead and position the back cover to the back of the phone. Then we're gonna go ahead and squeeze on all sides of this back glass. Go around all of the edges giving it pressure and squeezing them firmly together so that the adhesive can do its job and glue back on.",

      "transcript": "hello everyone this is matt from real world review and today we're going to replace the screen on the samsung s10 so the tools you're going to need are a ph triple zero bit a razor blade of some sort a plastic pick a pry tool a playing card some adhesive some glue as well as some heat and if you're using the glue you definitely want some clamps so the first thing you want to do is add some heat to the back of the phone well technically the first thing you want to do is remove the sim card tray and i recommend going around the phone and then focusing on the bottom portion of it so we add some heat and then we're going to use a flat blade to lift up the back just a little bit and put a playing card in between next we're going to use that playing card to cut through the adhesive if it gets difficult feel free to add some heat just make sure not to add too much heat so we're going to lift up the bottom portion then the left and right side then when we get to the top we're going to lift up the back kind of like shown just make sure not to add too much pressure or else the back could break then what we're going to do is add some heat to the top and slowly lift it up some adhesive might stick to the phone so you can cut through it like shown the next thing we're going to do you can remove this adhesive once you're done but i'm going to remove it right now because the adhesive is a little bit warm and easier to remove next we're going to grab the ph triple zero bit and remove the 15 screws then we're going to use a pry tool to kind of pry in this area right here to lift up this plastic piece and using that pride up area we're gonna lift up the second plastic piece right here once we take that off we unplug the battery and then we're gonna grab the ph triple zero bit and remove these three screws make sure to put them in order just like the back screws next we're gonna unplug the screen the headset jack and the front camera as well as removing the front camera then we're going to lift right here and remove the logic board make sure to start at the top and lift up the charging port area last next we're going to evaluate the screen that we have in this case i have the speaker and the vibrating mechanism all here so all i need to remove is the headset jack and the battery so for the headset jack we're just going to pry in this little area and it should just come out pretty easily and then for the battery we're going to use a plastic pry tool but if that doesn't work then we want to use this metal pry tool but remember to make sure to be careful around this battery because you don't want to puncture it so i recommend doing short prize like this until the battery lifts up and then you want to get a plastic pick in there once you cut through one side of adhesive you can just lift up the battery like shown and it should come out now i already have the vibrating mechanism on the new screen but i'll show you how to remove it really quickly then i'll refer to my s10 plus screen replacement video to show you how to remove the top speaker and then we'll put it back so now we have the new screen we're going to put in the headset jack and then we're going to set in the logic board starting with the bottom portion and then moving up to the top portion then we're going to put the bottom two screws in and the screw that goes above the right camera next we're going to put in the front camera because putting it in first is kind of annoying at some point plug in the screen and then we're going to plug in the battery and then we're going to set it back into the phone i didn't have to put new adhesive on there but make sure to put new adhesive if your adhesive gets destroyed and now we can put on the plastic piece so make sure that your battery is plugged in if you unplugged it and then put in the plastic piece starting with the bottom part add some screws to hold that in place and then we can put in the top part remember if the screws don't line up they're going to be difficult to put in so make sure that you line up the plastic piece perfectly once that's all good remember to remove any adhesive that's on the back of this phone because we're going to add our own adhesive so what we're going to do is just kind of cut right here and then cut right here cut on the top and cut on the bottom then i'm going to apply the remaining adhesive right here next thing you want to do is grab your glue and go around the edges where you put the adhesive as well as some on the bottom and a little bit on the top then all you need to do is set the back down and apply some clamps to make sure that that back stays in place then we're going to let this sit for about 30 minutes take off the clamps clean up any adhesive that's stuck on the phone and then we're all set also remember to put the sim card tray back in the phone if you have any questions leave them in the comment section or on twitter matt of rdbr and feel free to follow me on the social media listed above subscribe to my channel so you can see more repair videos as well as review videos and hit that bell button so that

      "title": "How to Repair an iPhone Xr Screen - The Easiest Way",
      "transcript": "thank you for joining us for another eye doctor \nUK video I'm Ollie and today I'm going to show   you step by step how to replace a broken screen \non the iPhone XR for the link to what I think is   the best aftermarket screen available and the \ntools required to complete the job check out   the description below let's get this started by \nremoving the two pentalobe screws in the bottom   of the phone that along with the adhesive secure \nthe screen into place also make sure you're using   the right screwdriver for this because they are \nquite easy to round off next take a razor blade   and make a small gap between the metal chassis \nof the phone and a plastic bezel on the screen   once you've made a small opening take a guitar \npick and insert it into the Gap you just made   with the razor blade then slide it from \nthe bottom along the two long edges and   the bottom edge of the phone that should have \ncut and loosened the adhesive enough around the   edges so that all you'll need to do is wiggle the \nscreen to loosen the top Edge and open it as if   you're opening a hook backwards avoid folding \nthe screen all the way back and potentially   damaging the airspeaker flex cable I use this \nlogic board holder to keep the screen propped   up whilst I'm working on it you can also use \nan empty mug or something like that to do the   same thing now that we're inside the phone \ntake the Y triple zero tri-wing screwdriver   and unscrew these three screws holding the \nshield down that cover the battery connector   then move on to the two connectors \nholding down the LCD and touch connectors   and finally remove the three tri-win \nscrews and single Phillips head screw   that holds down the front \nsensor and air speaker Flex you can now take some tweezers and \nlift those Shields up and put them   in a safe place for reassembly later foreign next take a plastic Pine tool and disconnect \nthe battery connector to isolate power from   the device you can now safely disconnect \nthe two screen connectors and finally the   connector on the ear speaker Flex the screen \nis now totally disconnected from the logic   board and can be lifted away from the phone \nand as you can see here it took most of the   adhesive away with it but if there is some \nleft behind take some tweezers and remove   all the leftover black tape from the chassis \nit's important not to skip this step because   the new seal that you'll install next will \nnot stick properly onto an uneven surface   once you've removed all the adhesive take \nsome isopropyl alcohol and a small cleaning   brush and clean the edge of the chassis \nto remove any leftover residue from the   old seal a clean toothbrush will do the job \nhere if you don't have one of these brushes   just make sure it's clean or new and not the \nbrush you cleaned your teeth with this morning foreign now take a new seal and carefully \nline it up with the edges of the phone and   place it down the screen I'm using in \nthis video comes with a new adhesive in   the kit and this is a really important \nstep if you want a professional finish   once the seal is lined up take the flat end of \nthe plastic spudger and flatten the adhesive down   before removing the guide film from \nthe top of the seal with some tweezers if you want to keep the true tone function on \nyour device you really don't want to skip this   step to keep true tone you'll need one of these \nscreen programmers just connect the old screen   to it first and choose read on the menu it will \ncopy all the information held in the screen onto   the programmer and then you can attach the new \nscreen choose the option to write in the data   and wait for the programmer to do its thing if \nyou're replacing the screen for personal use you   might be happy to skip the true term programming \nthe device is an additional cost and you probably   don't want to Fork out on a new machine just for \none job but if you want to sell the phone on in   the future it's important to know they might \nreduce the phone's value if it's picked up on foreign for installation starting by removing this \near speaker and sensor Flex from the old   screen unscrew the single tri-wing screw in \nthe top left and the three Phillips head screws   then unfold the ear speaker away from the screen   you now need to heat up the adhesive underneath \nthe sensors so they can be removed without   damaging them I use a heat gun for this because \nI've got one but you can easily use a hair dryer   for this instead you need to be very careful with \nthese sensors because if they become damaged they   could cause face ID not to work or cause the \nphone to boot loop when reconnected once the   area is warmed up take some tweezers and carefully \nlift each sensor away from the back of the screen   starting with the ambient light sensor then \nthe proximity sensor foreign ly the microphone   once they're freed lift the flex away and keep \nthis part safe ready to install onto the new   screen to prepare the new screen first remove \nany plastic films from the back of the screen   once the films are removed take the ear speaker \nand place the sensors into their corresponding   slots it's important to make sure they sit all \nthe way in because if they're protruding it   will mean the ear speaker won't sit properly \nand could damage the new screen once you're   happy with the positioning reinstall the \nlittle metal clip this can be a bit fiddly   just take your time it might take a couple of \ntries to get it in but it will eventually go   back with some concentration next take the \nair speaker and refold it over the sensors   then secure the three Phillips head screws and \nthe little tri-wing screw on the left foreign the screen is now prepared and ready to install \ncarefully offer up the screen flexors to the   phone and press down on them until you get the \nclick and you will know they're in place repeat   the same process with the airspeaker flex then \nsecure the flex down with the shield and screws   remember that the top right hand \nscrew is a Phillips screw and   the rest of the screws are all \nthe same size tri-wing screws foreign secure down the LCD flexors \nwith the shield and two screws then moving down to the bottom reconnect the \nbattery the same way you did with screen flexors   and install the L-shaped shield and three \nscrews foreign be careful when installing the   screw closest to the screen flexors because \nit's very close and can be easily damaged   do a quick check to make sure that all the \nscrews that you took out have been put back in   then turn the phone on and test it   if you transfer true tone over make sure that \nit's working properly and the brightness is good   it's also a good idea to check the LCD looks good \non both adult background and a live background and   finally that touch is fully working remove \nthe last layer of film on your does seal   and fold the screen down to close the device \nthen starting from the top of the phone place   the screen into place then apply pressure \nto the edges and the bottom of the screen   perform a quick visual inspection \naround all the edges of the phone   to make sure the screen is set flat \nand properly in place before finally   installing the two pentalobe screws back \ninto the bottom of the phone foreign thank you for watching I hope this guide \nhas helped you and I'll see you next time",

      "transcript": "welcome back to another eye doctor UK video in this video I'm going to show you how to replace the screen on the iPhone XR with detailed step-by-step instructions the first thing that we need to do is remove the two pentalobe screws from the bottom of the device I'll then take a single sided razor blade and create a small opening between the screen and the chassis of the phone I'll now pry upwards in the Gap that I've just created to break the seal between the screen and the chassis and then taking a plastic guitar pick insert it a couple of millimeters into the Gap you've just created to make a larger Gap enough to slide it up the edges of the phone once you've created a gap on one side work your way around the bottom Edge and slide it through to create another gap on the opposite side there's no need to pry on the top Edge instead lift from the bottom of the screen give the phone a little wiggle and pull upwards like opening a book from the back cover there might be some of this black adhesive left over just pull that out of the way as well now that we're inside the phone it can be helpful to put some a heavy object like a mug behind the screen to keep it from falling over before attempting to remove the screen it's important to isolate power from the device so go ahead and remove the three tri-wing screws on this L-shaped bracket underneath the cables for the screen there will be quite a few screws to remove during this repair so it's important to keep organized using a magnetic mat like this one and laying out the screws in the order that you remove them use some tweezers to lift that Shield away and store that safely for reinstallation later now take a plastic spudger and disconnect the battery connector we can now unscrew the two screws holding down the screen flexors and again using the tweezers lift the shield away then use your plastic spudger to disconnect the two Flex cables the screen's almost released now but before we lift it away we need to release this Shield at the top of the phone which is held down by three tri-wing screws and one cross head screw use the tweezers again to remove the shield followed by the spudger to disconnect the flex cable for the air speaker and front sensors we can now move the heavy object from behind the screen and pull the screen away from the phone before we start getting the new screen ready we need to First remove any of the old adhesive left behind on the chassis of our phone using tweezers just pull away any of the old adhesive to ensure there's a clean surface for our new seal to stick to once all the excess adhesive has been removed take a small brush like a toothbrush and remove any excess dust on the chassis of the phone foreign take special care around this front camera area because any damage to this Crystal here may render face ID useless now that the chassis is prepared we can take a new adhesive seal and install that to the edges of the phone I always start in the top left corner make sure that the left hand Edge is lined up properly and then the rest of the seal should follow in alignment take the spudger and apply pressure to each edge of the device to make sure that it's stuck down properly and then peel back the top layer of the film leaving behind this small thin layer around the edges which will remove when it's time to seal up the device put the chassis to one side and take the broken screen now and to ensure that face ID Works after the repair we need to carefully transfer over this ear speaker and sensor array so start by removing the Three cross head screws and finally the single tri-wing screw in the top left you can now unfold the air speaker away from the screen and then use tweezers to lift away this small bracket from on top of the ambient light sensor the sensors just here is stuck down with some fairly strong adhesive so it's important to warm up the area before removing it you can use a hair dryer for this or heat gun but the aim is just to warm the adhesive a little so that it softens it now take your plastic spudger pry underneath the cables to lift out the proximity sensor followed by the ambient light sensor and finally the front microphone now that that's released we can install it onto our new screen I'll stick a link in the description for where to buy one of these to start off from removing any of the blue peel on the back of the display and then begin reversing the steps that we've just taken to remove the sensors and ear speaker lining up the proximity sensor first followed by the ambient light sensor sliding into place that small metal bracket this can be a little bit fiddly so take your time and get it right once that's in place fold over the air speaker lining up the holes with the screw holes on the screen and then re-secure the four screws before we reinstall this screen it's important to note that the iPhone XR has the true tone feature on it and the only way to retain that when replacing the screen is by copying the data from the original screen onto the new display we use one of these true tone programming machines to copy the data and then paste it onto our new screen now that we've transferred that we can begin reinstalling the screen onto the phone to do this offer up the screen flexors to their related positions and ensure that they're lined up above the connector in the right place and then apply pressure to the connector ensuring that it seats correctly on there it can be a little bit fiddly to line up properly but once you've got the first one in the rest should line up pretty well you can place the heavy object behind the screen again to free up one of your hands then reconnect the airspeaker flex cable to the top and finally reconnect the battery we can now begin reinstalling the shields starting with from the bottom with this L-shaped bracket and the three tri-wing screws then the small bracket for the screen two tri-wing screws finally the top Shield can be reinstalled just be careful and make sure that you slide the shield underneath this small bracket here install the three tri-wing screws followed by the single cross head screw in the top right of the Shield and now the phone's ready to be sealed up before we close the phone we need to remove that last layer of blue film on the adhesive and then close up the phone make sure you peel this last bit of adhesive off to reinstall the screen into place start by placing the top of the screen into the top of the phone and then close up the device squeezing the edges all the way around the final thing to do is to install the two pentalobe screws at the bottom and then boot the phone using the power button I'll then check to make sure that true tone is transferred over correctly and also turn down the brightness to its lowest setting cover up the top Air speaker area and then uncover it to make sure that the ambient light sensor and proximity sensor work correctly it's important to also take make a test call with the device to make sure that the ear speakers working and you can also pick up an app and drag it around the screen to make sure that touch is functioning as it should do that just about completes this repair thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign",

      "title": "$35 iPhone XR Destroyed By A Lawn Mower Lets Restore It!",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge freeze video in this video i'm going to be restoring this mangled iphone 10r that has been run over by a lawnmower the back screen and frame have all been obliterated in the lower corner from the right angle you can see directly into the phone we won't know the full extent of the damage until we open the phone but i can already see some rust this phone was purchased on ebay in its current condition from someone who had purchased it themselves to users parts as it was locked they sold it onto me opening up the parcel i found a little note inside from the seller turns out they're a huge fan of the channel let's see what we can do with their phone the first thing i'll need to do is test the phone itself does it actually work and what parts am i going to need i will open up the phone by removing the two pentalobe screws at the bottom before prying up the display as the seller had already opened this phone up himself the display came up without any heat i'll start by removing the main bracket covering the lcd display cable there's a small barcode on the cable itself that indicates what brand of display is fitted we'll need a replacement of the same brand later on so it's important to take note of it now i'll continue by removing the remaining two brackets and the flex cables for both the battery and display setting the screen aside we can get a proper look at the internals the blade has not only cut through the frame but into the taptic engine the charging port is also badly broken with a microphone ripped from its cable the liquid indicators are also red with rust surrounding the taptic engine and a small amount of corrosion my guess would be the wet blades from the lawnmower have introduced a small amount of liquid inside i've purchased a new display so i can test out the phone this is a refurbished toshiba display included with it was a card that explains the issues that may arise if the wrong branded display is installed as i have the wider barcode i'll be installing a toshiba display panel onto this iphone 10r after connecting its two flex cables and reattaching the battery we can finally test out the phone with the press of a power button nothing happened but that was to be expected as it's probably flat so i tried a lightning charger still nothing losing hope i tried the wireless charger and sure enough this time around the battery flat icon appeared with the phone booting shortly after with no passcode in place i was able to browse around as it turns out this phone hasn't been used since early 2019. in settings it even thinks it's still under warranty while we're also in the about section we can see it's running ios 12.2 and is a 128 gig model with the heart of the phone alive it's time to get the rest of this phone fully functional and in great cosmetic condition with the new display out of the way i can get to work on removing the sim reader this is one of the select few iphones to feature a modular sim reader this means you can swap it out with a dual sim model to have two physical sim cards next the logic board needs to come out after unplugging several flex cables attaching to it four screws can be unfastened and the board can be lifted free proceeding i can remove the single camera from the iphone 10r after removing its bracket down at the bottom this is where things get interesting some of these components i'll be able to reuse others not the taptic engine doesn't work the charging port is damaged along with the antenna cable below it so i'll need to replace these i had a bit of difficulty getting out a screw that had rusted in place but with some persistence i got it out it's amazing to think that if this damage had occurred 5 centimeters higher it would have cut into the battery and likely would have caused the whole phone to combust removing what's left of the charging port and the antenna below it we can finally take out the battery after removing the two bottom strips it was time for the top ones although i couldn't get to them as they were stuck down too tightly so i had to resort to using some alcohol and prying to get the battery free now we're getting down to the lower level components as we're swapping the phone into a new housing everything inside needs to be removed and transferred into that new housing this is easier said than done unfortunately iphones have the most amount of components screws brackets and other tiny little components when compared to other smartphones as such this process is extremely time consuming after removing the wireless charging module the insides of this phone look empty but there's still a few more cables antennas brackets clips springs and mesh grilles that all need to come out after removing this top antenna from the phone there is still a couple of gold contacts and some pads that are sitting behind them that need to come out hiding behind this piece of plastic is the volume and mute switch which will need to be unfastened and removed it's connected via a flex cable to the power button led flash and rear microphone this flex cable needs to be removed delicately as it's very easy to damage under that cable is a piece of plastic that helps guide the led flash into place as well as a tiny mesh grille for the microphone we'll remove these too on the sides there are several clips which help hold in the lcd display panel these will need to be unfastened and removed from the phone of course we can't forget the sim eject pin which helps the sim card tray eject from the sim reader at this point i'll take out the spring and retaining brackets from both the volume and power buttons lastly the nfc antenna can be removed before the mesh grilles from the microphone and speaker ports there are plastic pieces that hold the mesh grilles in place so they'll need to come out first once they're out each grille can be taken out and put aside this fiddly and time-consuming process is why many people who crack the fragile glass back on their iphone don't get it fixed however if you wanted to attempt something like this yourself get a housing with all the small components already installed i do this myself but i have a plan for this phone that requires me to remove everything at this stage we finally removed everything so what's the plan well i'm going to be putting these components in a new housing i purchased this red one for just ten dollars it was so cheap as it lacks any branding no apple logo no iphone text of course i'm not going to all this trouble to fix this phone and have a generic back instead i'm going to make my own custom housing in a red and black theme so along with the housing i also purchased a black replacement glass panel merging the two together hopefully we'll have a really nice custom phone to separate the already installed red glass i'll need to use my laser machine using a template and a protective shield over the housing i should be able to remove the glue using a laser and not damage the frame after i'd positioned the laser i started the burn process which takes about 10 minutes to complete while i don't get to use my laser machine all that much it is a super handy tool when i need it i have made a dedicated video about it and how it works if you want to know more about the process the result was not as i'd hoped the physical shield i placed over the phone that cost me 15 was ineffective and didn't protect the laser from etching the side of the housing so i'll need to redo this process with another housing this time i made sure the software template was significantly smaller than the phone itself so it wouldn't happen again this time it was spot on so i can proceed to removing the glass the glue used by apple is like cement and is extremely hard to remove even after burning it with a laser but this aftermarket housing well it came out so much easier i will still have to break the glass to fully remove it as the glass sits under that camera lens with only the bear frame left we are almost ready to install the new sheet of glass but before we can do so the frame needs to be cleaned up and have any remaining glue removed after having cleaned off the frame using some alcohol it's now time to apply the new glue this glue was supplied with my laser machine and is what i've used on the few back glass replacements i've done i'll apply a bead around the perimeter and on the center of the device after which the glass panel can be attached and the residual glue that seeped out the sides can be wiped off with a tissue to make sure the panel sits flush i'll apply some rubber bands to hold it in place while the glue dries as the new glass won't sit under the camera lens we'll need to fill that void with glue to ensure the red ring around the lens doesn't fall down after that's done i can install the camera lens into the frame one dilemma i had was what color should the buttons be black or red what would you choose i like the look of both but ultimately chose the red ones that blend in with the frame the new red buttons come pre-installed with their black grommets so they're ready to go in although this phone isn't back together yet i'm already loving this black and red design i have attempted it before on another iphone 10r although did it the other way round with a black frame and red back that configuration didn't look great at all but this time around i think i've got it right once the power and volume buttons are installed it's time for the mute switch it's fastened into place onto the flex cable itself i'll need to loosen two strips to remove the old mute switch before i can install the red one after tightening those straps back down that flex cable can now be attached into the phone with that cable installed it's time for the nfc antenna to be installed up top next to that camera lens before the wireless charging module can be reattached into position using some e8000 liquid adhesive this wireless charging coil isn't going anywhere after reinstalling the two screws going to a random sensor in the frame i can start reattaching the lcd display brackets after first bending back the really bent one that was down at the lower section in our old frame with this build i'm trying to reuse as much of the components that came out as i possibly can of course some things like the taptic engine were just too far gone and didn't function at all so will need to be replaced but as for that display bracket it was easily bent back into position up at the top there's some gold contacts foam pads and an antenna that need to be fastened back into place it has a few loose pieces that need to be attached on some screw holes so using some tweezers i can line those up correctly the tedious process of reinstalling the mesh grilles and plastic retaining pieces will be undertaken next many technicians who perform a housing swap will miss out on things like this while i do my repairs properly it's not hard to understand why steps like these get missed with that job done it's now time to install the lower antenna and charging port these are both new components that i'll be installing i've chosen a red charging port for this phone to match in with the red frame i will install the microphone bracket next before the speaker and new taptic engine go in as these pieces are being installed the phone is starting to come together after the lower section of the phone is assembled it's time to move back up to the top where i'm going to install the rear-facing camera after placing the module back in i'll clean it off before installing its bracket and two screws it is finally time for the logic board to be reinstalled positioning it down into place making sure no flex cables are trapped beneath it i can reinstall the four screws and start reconnecting all of the flex cables that attach to our logic board with that it's time to install the front-facing cameras and the three cables connecting to the logic board it's important that none of these get damaged or face id will not function after reinstalling the sim eject pin the sim card reader can be reinstalled with its three screws before installing the new display we first need to program it using a display reprogrammer tool in order to retain apple's true tone function for this i'll copy the serial numbers from our old display over to our new one before we can discard the old display we'll also need to remove the earpiece flex cable which houses some of the components used for apple's face id system if these are damaged or not installed the face id system won't function as both the earpiece flex cable and front-facing cameras are paired to each iphone's motherboard a replacement won't fix the issue so it's vital that these remain intact throughout the repair after it's swapped across to our new display panel it's time to install the battery i'll reapply some fresh battery adhesive strips before setting it down into position in our iphone 10r after which a dust and water resistant seal can be applied to the frame of the phone after positioning it down into place the protective film can be removed and our new display panel can be attached to the phone i'll reinstall the two brackets and several tri-wing screws before reattaching the battery and installing the last remaining bracket finally the internals of the device can be wiped down with a microfiber cloth to remove any fingerprints or dust remaining inside before the protective film over the adhesive is removed and the display panel is seated into position to our new housing the two pentalobe screws can be reinstalled into the bottom of the phone as well as the sim card tray before we remove the plastic protective film from both the back and front of the display as for the device being locked while i took care of that and had icloud switched off now all that's left to do is reset the phone and remove the last owner's stuff and with that we're done so this is it a once junk iphone 10r has been restored and customized with a red and black design i think it looks really good and definitely makes it stand out from the crowd what we're left with is a fully working iphone 10r 128 gigabyte on ios 12.2 it has 100 battery health and only 52 charge cycles given just how few charges this battery has seen shows just how short of a life this iphone 10r has had with a red frame and a black back this iphone 10r now looks a lot like my blackberry key2le which has the same color scheme and

      "title": "How to fix a cracked iPhone XR screen",
      "transcript": "today i'm going to be replacing my neighbor's iphone xr screen and it looks like later i'm going to be getting myself three mcdoubles thanks neighbor whenever i fix a phone it's always fun to hear people's stories of how it broke and in this case my neighbor said that she got a brand new puppy and it bit the screen which then caused it to go crazy like you see here surprisingly the touchscreen still works and i was able to even take pictures she said she's been using it like this for about a week which is pretty amazing because after 30 seconds of looking at it i started to hallucinate and get really sleepy the iphone xr is one of the easiest iphone screens to replace especially because you can get a full assembly kit like this on amazon which has all the tools you'll need i'll have the screen and tools linked below in the description to get started on the screen the first step is to take out the sim card then remove the two screws near the charging port using a 0.8 pentalobe bit before going forward take off any screen covers or protective glass like this power off the phone then use a heat gun or hair dryer to heat up the adhesive around the outside edge of the screen after you've heated it for a while use your plastic tools to go around the outside edge to open up the screen you'll want to open it pivoting on the right side but be careful not to go past about 150 degrees otherwise you could rip these ribbon cables next grab this .6 y-bit screwdriver and remove the two screws holding down the protective plate covering the two ribbon cables these y-bit screws tend to strip pretty easily so make sure you have a good grip before you take them out before i go any further i'm gonna need to disconnect the battery the battery connection is under this plate which is held down by three screws it's always a good idea to disconnect the battery first whenever you work on electronics so you don't short anything out the battery is disconnected so now i can take off the final ribbon cable this last ribbon cable is under a plate in the top right corner and there's five screws holding it down the first three screws are the same zero wide tip bit but the other two screws require a size triple zero phillips screwdriver as you take out the two screws you need to be careful that you don't lose this tiny bracket because it can fall off the plate when you pick it up now you may have noticed that apple loves to put tiny screws in their iphone so it's important to keep them organized i like to use these magnetic boxes in this rubber mat to keep track of each step that i take out the screws these mats are great but you can also draw boxes on a piece of paper to keep everything organized with that ribbon cable removed i now need to take off the proximity sensor on this old screen there's going to be four screws around the outside that are holding it down as i remove the last screw i can fold the sensor down in half to see inside of it it's extremely important that you're careful not to tear the ribbon cable or else you could lose the ability to use face id on the top of the sensor is a tiny plate that i need to remove this is also very fragile and you can avoid damaging it by pulling it straight out when you disconnect it for this next part use the flat end of your pry tool and slide underneath the proximity sensor at the very top is this earpiece which is held down by adhesive so it takes a little bit of pressure to get it out these proximity sensors are exclusively programmed to your iphone for security purposes so if it's damaged you won't be able to have face id and with that i'm done with my old screen so now i can set it aside on the new screen first peel off any plastic on the back then grab the proximity sensor for your face id to set it in place align it over the earpiece slot and press it down once the earpiece is set fold it back over so the four screws line up before i tighten everything down i'm going to put in this super tiny metal bracket this can be kind of hard putting back in but i found the best way is to line it up and then press it straight in brackets on so now i'm good to tighten the four screws having the camera proximity sensor and speaker all in one unit makes putting this thing back together a lot easier i'm going to start with the top proximity sensor then move to the bottom display cables usually the bottom two ribbon cables for the display are straight so you may need to give them a slight bend so they align to the connections before you attach the display cables make sure you reconnect the batteries and put on the plate remember that when you put on the plate that covers the proximity sensors to include the tiny bracket it just slides right over the hole for the screw oh hi little guy i think my five-year-old son just came in to remind me to test everything on the screen is working before i seal it all down so before i close it i'm going to power it up to test everything out there's no more crazy flickering on the screen and i had no problems with the touch sensor everything's good so i'm going to power it off and put on the waterproof seal then tighten the bottom two screws this phone had nearly all of its waterproof seal intact so i didn't need to put the new one on and just tighten it down and put in the sim card this screen kit came with a tempered glass protector so i'm gonna throw that on now and now we're done thanks so much for watching me help my neighbor fix her phone if this was helpful check out my other apple repair videos and have a great day",

Be careful not to go past about 150 degrees otherwise you could rip these ribbon cables. plate in the top right corner and there's five screws holding it down the first three screws are the same zero wide tip bit but the other two screws require a size triple zero phillips screwdriver as you take out the two screws you need to be careful that you don't lose this tiny bracket because it can fall off the plate when you pick it up. ability to use face id on the top of the sensor is a tiny plate that i need to remove this is also very fragile and you can avoid damaging it by pulling it straight out when you disconnect it. These proximity sensors are exclusively programmed to your iphone for security purposes so if it's damaged you won't be able to have face id. Having the camera proximity sensor and speaker all in one unit makes putting this thing back together a lot easier. Make sure you reconnect the batteries and put on the plate. off and put on the waterproof seal then tighten the bottom two screws this phone had nearly all of its waterproof seal intact so i didn't need to put the new one on. Just tighten it down and put in the sim card this screen kit came with a tempered glass protector so i'm gonna throw that on now and now we're done.",

      "title": "Google Pixel 3 XL Disassembly Teardown Repair Video",
      "transcript": "you're watching the Google pixel 3xl disassembly carry down video first thing we're gonna have to take off the plastic to the phone camera all brand-new first thing first take up a sim tray kind of find out where that this one's on the bottom usually I see them on the top or on the sides but gonna use your sim popping tool I'll put the sim tray next you're gonna heat up the back of the phone you can use a heat gun or mostly pull which don't have heat cones you can use a hairdryer blow dryer just heat it up a little bit so it softens the adhesive underneath so you can pry that back off okay after you heat up the back a little bit you're gonna need a pry tool preferably something plastic so you don't damage the frame of the phone and scratch it up I usually start with a guitar pick something thin and plastic that you can try to work your way in if you're having some trouble you can always use like a thin razor or something something to get into like one of the corners and then slide your prattling once you get your pry tool and just work your way around the phone to loosen the adhesive sometimes when the adhesive is strong you can use a plastic cart or something else to help you I'm gonna use a Costco card I have it makes a little bit easier so on this one I found the surprisingly hard to take the back off the adhesive is very strong especially on the bottom right corner of the phone has some strong adhesive once you have the back pretty much pry it off just be careful don't lift it completely off because there's a cable for the fingerprint reader over here so the cables attached over here on the motherboard you're gonna have to disconnect that cable I'm gonna use a pair of tweezers just to peel off the yellow tape that's on the connector so be careful not to touch anything metal on the phone because you'd be using metal against metal all right once you got that tape peeled off go ahead and pop off the lock over here for the connector pop it up once the lock is unlocked slide out the cable you can take your back off alright next we've got another yellow protective tape over here peel that off then you're gonna use a t4 or t5 I usually like to use one size larger because in my experience it strips to let the screws less go ahead and unscrew these two t4 screws move that matter of metal cover next you got 15 more t4 screws you're gonna have to remove their to make their out the foam go ahead and remove those screws keep in mind you're gonna have two screws hidden over here on meetha adhesive so pulled adhesive a way to get to those screws all right now once you've got your screws removed also keep in mind that the screws vary in sizes some are longer than the other ones so put them down accordingly so you remember which ones go where he'll make it easier for you later on when you're reassembling it go ahead and take out this metal plate held on with some adhesive very tiny adhesive strips underneath it put that aside go ahead and remove the top over here that aside alright next there's a cable over here for the bottom speaker assembly boy Don Pablo tech connector just pump it up once you just connect that you're gonna work your weight there's some adhesive over here on the meter speaker holding the assembly down just pry it off that aside remove this cover that's on top of your charger for assembly also looks like as a water damage indicator over here the sticker which would probably turn pink or red if it gets in contact with liquid all right go ahead and connect your battery cable over here the nice disconnect the cable over here for your wallet wireless charging pad you have two more cables over here go ahead disconnect those two cables and then you got the screen cable over here disconnect that as well next we've got two tables over here for their cameras and on the top disconnect those cables as well there you go one more cable over here let's connect this one now you've got seven more t4 screws you're gonna have to remove four are gonna be up here which are on the board mainly and you got three down here that are screwing in the charger port flex cable area to the frame of the phone order remove those screws you right now let's go the screws removed moves top cover that goes over the cameras that aside next one our motors cameras there's somebody useful on time so now up here in the top left-hand corner above the back facing camera you have one small cable that leads to a microphone on top : disconnect a cable next go ahead and lift up his tape over here off the battery and then I'm going to lift up the board also be careful because these cables over here that are attached to the area where the charger port is are connected to board underneath it so you're going to want to lift it up together you're gonna have to slide out the charger port connector from a slot in the frame once that's out those are the port unicorn over here out to well here's your board underneath it you know it's kind of some kind of thermal tape or Osumi that's what it is something looks like some kind of a thermal tape that's a toner that touches the frame on the bottom then you got the cables sadly to the charger port over here the white and black one so just pop those off and you could replace this whole entire assembly over here and you got the connector for the front or the featherbed for the back facing camera over here just connect that so I just pointed left with the battery the frame you got your ear speaker over here you got a microphone over here and you got your vibrator motor over here and if you want to replace this screen you just remove the battery by pulling the pull tabs over here there's two of them and then just pry out the battery so you can get access to the cable for the screen over here which is underneath it and then you would have to heat up a screen and pry it off from the mid frame you just use a product will go along the sides and then put your new screen on or it's much easier if you just find a little spring that has a mid frame already attached to it all right now we're gonna go ahead and reassemble the phone all right go ahead and attach the main camera back to the board once your cameras back on go ahead and put the mainboard back in just make sure none of the cables get stuck underneath it you the chart report assembly back in this place I'm gonna make sure none of your cables get stuck underneath our next going to put your screws back on for the bottom area of the charger port you I put that color we're gonna char your port we're gonna screw in place or once that's in place put a speaker assembly back in once that's back in go ahead and put the screws back in you all right next go ahead and connect cables back to the board this was bottom once for a speaker assembly your screen came over here your wireless charging cable and you go to your power button volume up and down cable over here your earpiece cable here and go ahead and put your front-facing cameras back in nice connect your microphone cable over here in the corner above the camera once that's connected I'm gonna put your cover that covers the cameras over here back over we're going to put the screws back we're the cover that goes up over the cameras maybe one screw over here on the silver part and the one over here on this other silver part you our next we're going to put this top cover back on and just let you know for anyone who's having any type of reception issue and your Wi-Fi issue this piece is something I'll take a look at because it has some antenna Ram antenna lines running through it just use 10 color lines and also there's gold points over here underneath it which make contact to certain areas of the board so this is something this would be something that I'd be looking into now go ahead and put the screws back in all right now once you've got those screws in place go ahead and connect the battery cable over here to the board once your batteries connected put the metal cover back over all those cables and then go ahead and screw it back in place all right nice put the cover that covers your power button cable back over I'm going to screw it in place you alright next you're gonna take your back over and connect to your fingerprint scanner back to the main board once that's in press the lockdown to lock it in put your yellow protector sticker back over to connect there and then if you need to reapply a new adhesive put your back cover back over you can apply some heat to make the adhesive attach better are on the phone and you're done",

      "title": "Google Pixel 3 Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge FPS video in this video i'm gonna be restoring this Google pixel 3 I purchased this phone from eBay for 300 Australian dollars now while this phone still works it has a smash screen and back panel as of making this video this is a latest smartphone from Google which retails for $1,200 now before we get started I'd like to think I fix it for sponsoring this video get parts tools and guides at ifixit.com slash u Jeffries or the link below right on with the video so to begin I'm going to need to remove this back panel first which will allow me access inside the phone to do that I heated up the back with a rework station then applied a suction cup to the back which allowed me to put a little Jimmy tool in between the glass and the frame of the phone so I could actually get enough of a gap in so I can insert some plastic pics now my aim for this is to remove the back panel without trying to further damage it luckily I was able to heat up these sides enough that I got a nice big chunk and didn't crack any more of the bottom off the phone moving up to the top though that was a little bit of a different story because it is completely shattered so I did have to sort of break away most of the glass which shattered into a million pieces it also should be noted that you should be wearing safety glasses for this because the glass has a tendency to just absolutely fly all over the room with all the glass loosened up I can lift away at the back panel being careful not to take it off too far though because I'll need to disconnect the fingerprint reader from the back which is connected with a flex cable taking a look at the new replacement back housing which I sourced out of Aliexpress as I fix it was actually out of stock on this part you can see it's clearly a used part off of a google pixel 3 which is disappointing considering it cost me $46 anyway moving along I'll need to remove the camera lens and fingerprint reader from the old back glass to transfer across to the new one with a bit of heat and some prying those came right off now I also need to apply some new adhesive to these later on but for now I'm just going to move across and clean up and remove as much of the adhesive from the new back panel as it's clearly used with that ready and prep to go I'm going to cut some fresh adhesive for the fingerprint reader and camera lens now I would have preferred to use an official sort of gasket or sealant which would have originally been on here but for this video I'm just going to apply some adhesive cut off of a roll with that pressed into place you can see it is now looking quite nice I'll need to install the fingerprint reader next and pressing that down into place completes this back panel we can now move across to the phone itself and start disassembling it by removing a few screws and taking off the wireless charging coil next we can disconnect the battery first to avoid damaging any internal components of the phone now the phone has no power I can remove the front cameras from the device the screw itself was actually hidden under some glass from the old back panel which I will actually clean up later on these cameras are glued in place so you need to be extra careful when removing them not to damage or tear the cable with that removed I can disconnect this flex cable and move down to the lower half of the phone where I can remove the speaker assembly there is many grounding Clips throughout this phone so you'll need to make sure to keep those safe and reinstall them when the time comes to reassemble the device with the speaker removed I can then disconnect a few of these antenna wires and D route them from their little cable routes and clips making sure to disconnect the flex cable for the dock connector and SIM card reader I can move back up to the top of the phone where I can disconnect a whole heap of Flex cables which are connecting to the motherboard of the phone with all those removed only a few screws hold this motherboard in place so removing those of course making sure to keep those grounding clips safe which are connecting to the frame of the device we can then pry it up a little bit getting it loose before folding it to one side and being able to remove the board in one giant big piece this is also a very fragile component of the device so be careful when removing that next I can clean up the frame and remove any of the remaining glass left by the old back glass which was completely shattered with all of that glass pried away and removed I can then finally remove the front panel I'll need to apply more heat to remove this as you guessed it it's held in by adhesive now you can really start at either the bottom or the top of the device considering the bottom of this phone was shattered I decided to start at the top placing a suction cup on the screen I can use a Jimmy tool to get in between the frame and glass of the screen I didn't have quite enough room so sliding it across a little bit I could then finally push a pic underneath the glass as you can see it's actually going in between the glass and the OLED panel to make the screen come out easier I will apply heaps of heat to the panel to make the removal process easier unfortunately Google has used glue on the sides top bottom and in the middle of the screen this makes the removal process much more difficult and will result in completely destroying the screen in the removal process I actually thought that I got my pics underneath the screen assembly so I continued sliding them around continuing heating up the phone at the same time so I could remove the screen easier when I lifted up the screen though you can see that I actually only got my pic about halfway through the OLED screen and that's because it's glued down to the back of the frame so with a little bit more force and some prying you can see that I can finally remove this screen so if your old screen was working removing it will completely destroy it however we aren't changing the screen so that's no big deal next I can remove all of the remaining glass and adhesive to prep this for the new adhesive and the new display to go on this process actually took quite a lot of time because I wanted to make sure to remove all of the adhesive that I possibly could to make the new screen seal in as best as it could so that's everything disassembled that we need to to get access to replace the display talking about the display we're of course going to need a new one so this one has been sent to me by I fix it to install on this Google pixel 3 you can see this is an LG display just like the original found on the device so we're going to be getting original quality on my Google pixel 3 so I'll start by removing the grills from the old screen and transferring them across to this new panel with those installed I can prep the frame of the device with a new band of adhesive which will hold the new screen in place it's important to make sure this is lined up because you don't want any excess adhesive going out the sides of the phone as that will make the repair job look very unprofessional with everything pressed down and sealed into place I can then remove the protective film in place of the adhesive and get the new screen and remove all of its protective films and reveal its new adhesive for the middle section of the screen and it's time to reassemble the two halves back together I like to align both the top and bottom first and pressing those in place and then proceeding along to the sides that seems to make everything sealed down very good next I can install the motherboard back into this Google pixel 3 making sure not to snag any of the cables and rerouting everything as necessary there is also a very fragile piece of tape which goes from the motherboard itself and across to the battery this was torn of course when I removed the motherboard and I didn't have anything to replace it with so I just tried to stick it back as best I could I believe this might just be something to tell Google if they ever work on your phone or do a warranty repair that you've obviously been inside the device anyway I can connect everything up and begin screwing everything on the motherboard itself back into place making sure to attach the grounding clips in their proper location next up to be reinstalled into the pixel three is the two front facing cameras the standard an ultra-wide I do recommend testing out the cameras when testing the device to make sure that they are functioning correctly and do this before you reinstall the back panel otherwise it is sealed down and you won't be able to get into the device and are probably likely to crack the panel trying to remove it I can then reinstall the speaker assembly screwing it back into place and connecting its flex cable making sure all the Flex cables throughout this device have been connected I can give the insides a wipe over making sure to remove any dust we're almost there it's time to reinstall the wireless charging coil and it's appropriate screws which help hold in some more components of the phone coming up to their last stages we can attach the new adhesive for the back panel I chose to install this on the frame of the phone rather than the back panel as I believed it would be easier to make it all line up pressing it down into place with a spudger it's time to remove the protective film covering up the adhesive itself now luckily this is in two parts so you can only remove one part and that will allow you to connect up the fingerprint reader for the back panel screwing it into place you can then remove the second layer of protective film on the adhesive which will then reveal the actual adhesive itself so you can stick the back panel into place making sure to align it just like the screen by making sure the top and bottom sections are aligned first I can then press it down into place sealing up this Google pixel 3 lastly I can remove the plastic film from both the back and front of this Google pixel 3 and this completes the restoration so this is it a Google pixel that I picked up for 300 Australian dollars and with some repairs to the screen and back set me back a total of 476 Australian dollars that's still much cheaper than the phone currently sells for this phone is decently repairable and this video hopefully will help you if you damaged or cracked your Google pixel 3 and you might even be able to skip the upgrade from the upcoming Google pixel 4 which is set for release in only a few days now now I didn't opt to replace the battery this device given it is under a year old and has been sitting in my repair pal for about two to three months so it should have plenty of life left in it now I'm actually going to be selling this pixel 3 as I definitely prefer my Galaxy S 9 to this device but this was a nice repair to have done I did also notice two little marks on the back housing as this was a used panel however the rest of it is absolutely perfect and on that note this has been a huge Aries video if you liked what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration playlist for more videos just like this one also make sure to follow me on my social media link for which is down in the description that's all for this video and I'll catch you guys next time",

      "summary": "This video shows how to restore a Google pixel 3 smartphone. The phone has a smash screen and back panel. It retails for $1,200. big chunk and didn't crack any more of the bottom off the phone moving up to the top though that was a little bit of a different story because it is completely shattered so I did have to sort of break away most of the glass which shattered into a million pieces it also should be noted that you should be wearing safety glasses for this because the glass has a tendency to just absolutely fly all over the room with all the glass loosened up I can lift away at the back panel being careful not to take it off too far though because I'll need to disconnect the fingerprint reader from the back which is connected with a flex cable. The back panel of the iPhone 6 is removed. The phone itself is then disassembled. device the screw itself was actually hidden under some glass from the old back panel which I will actually clean up later on these cameras are glued in place so you need to be extra careful when removing them not to damage or tear the cable with that removed I can disconnect this flex cable and move down to the lower half of the phone where I can remove the speaker assembly. The phone was completely shattered when it was taken out of the box. The glass was pried away and removed from the back of the device. The front of the phone was held in by adhesive. Google has used glue on the sides top bottom and in the middle of the screen this makes the removal process much more difficult and will result in completely destroying the screen. If your old screen was working removing it will completely destroy it however we aren't changing the screen so that's no big deal next I can remove all of the remaining glass and adhesive. to prep this for the new adhesive and the new display to go on this process actually took quite a lot of time because I wanted to make sure to remove all of the adhesive that I possibly could to make the new screen seal in. Google pixel 3 has a new screen and new adhesive for the middle section of the screen. I like to align both the top and bottom first and pressing those in place and then proceeding along to the sides that seems to make everything sealed down very good next I can install the motherboard back into this Google pixel 3 making sure not to snag any of the cables. inside the device anyway I can connect everything up and begin screwing everything on the motherboard itself back into place.

      "title": "Google Pixel 3a Teardown! - Sufficiently Simple",
      "transcript": "The Pixel 3a is a practically perfect phone. A pinnacle of photographic prowess, with a\nvalue that predicates panic among more painfully priced phones. It's also phenomenally preferred among people\nwho like to pinch pennies and pay profoundly less. A prerequisite to purchasing though, is to\npolitely, pragmatically, and painstakingly pry open the Pixel to pinpoint any potential\npitfalls. Let's get started. The trick with opening up the Pixel 3a is\nto know where to put your pry tool. With a little bit of heat the screen comes\noff first, and will most likely break during this process...if it's not already broken. The safest of the unsafe places to start is\nup at the top, between the glass screen and the first plastic lip, since the fragile ribbon\ncables are down along the bottom of the phone. After the adhesive at the top is cut, I can\nwork my way down each side of the phone with a soft piece of paper or card stock, because\nif anything touches the display underneath that glass, it will shatter. It's a dangerous operation. Lastly, after getting a small gap, I can use\na bit more heat and carefully take the same piece of paper and slice through the adhesive\nholding the bottom portion to the screen. Then the whole thing can lift off, exposing\na single ribbon connector under this black piece of tape. The ribbon goes through the mid frame to the\nmotherboard underneath with only 2 t3 screws holding the little silver bracket over the\nsingle Lego style ribbon cable. This could very well be the easiest screen\nreplacement of 2019. With no other steps involved, it's a super\nsimple way to fix the most often broken component of a cell phone. Nice work, Google. The Pixel 3a is much more repairable than\nthe more expensive Pixel 3. There are 14 more of these same t3 screws\nholding down the mid plate. I'll link the tool kit I use down in the video\ndescription. The metal mid plate is probably what kept\nthe Pixel 3a from snapping in half during my durability test. Once the screws are gone, I can now pry into\nthe second gap between the black plastic lip and the purplish plastic of the phone. Then the whole thing pulls away from the phone\nbody with just the top front earpiece attached to it. We get our first glimpse at what looks like\na very complex inner workings of the Pixel 3a, but it's actually not that bad. Let me show you. The battery connector is underneath the side\nsqueeze sensor ribbon. I'll unplug that and then pop off the extension\nribbon, just like a little Lego, on both ends. Then I'll unplug the right side squeeze sensor,\nand the left side squeeze sensor. Does anyone actually use the squeeze sensing\nfunctionality? I kind of forgot they existed until now. There is good news about the battery though. It has magical pull tabs, signifying a very\neasy battery replacement...that is, of course, if you don't break the pull tabs like an amateur\nand have to commence the Pry of Shame. I, of course, would never break a pull tab\non accident. I only do it purely for educational purposes. The battery is a 3000 milliamp hour capacity\nand does allow replacement by dogs. You can see how the left over pull tab adhesive\npulls away from under the battery. See? Education. Next I'll unplug the side button ribbon cable\nand our little friend the headphone jack. The jack does have a little water damage indicator\non the bottom. This phone is not water resistant, so if it\ndoes get wet, the sticker will turn pink, avoiding any warranties. Underneath the motherboard we have one little\nribbon cable for the rear fingerprint scanner, and two wire cables that run down along the\nleft side. The motherboard houses a singular 12.2 megapixel\ncamera unit, which does include optical image stabilization. This is supposedly one of the best cellphone\ncameras on the market right now, but I'll let the other tech YouTubers compare the actual\nphoto quality. We're here for the hardware. The front camera is an 8 megapixel little\nguy with no optical image stabilization. No thermal paste or heat pipe on this plastic\ncontraption. Down here at the bottom we have 3 screws,\none on the board and the other two on the sides of the USB-C charging port. This crazy little board has the ribbon connector\nfor the charging port, and it's own white water damage indicator sticker and a microphone. The USB-C port has no rubber ring around the\ntip, but it is super simple and easy to replace. I'm a huge fan of the modularity on the Pixel\n3a. If you want a cheap, easy to fix phone, with\nfeatures like a headphone jack, this is a great option. The bottom loud speaker for some reason is\nvery securely attached to the plastic frame, but is pretty large and has it's own gold\ncontact pads to communicate with the motherboard. The last interesting thing to come out of\nthe Pixel 3a are the side squeeze sensors hidden below this long plastic rod for the\nelectronic buttons. The squeeze sensor is embedded into the side\nof the phone, and is made up of little resistors that are sensitive to being flexed...even\nsensing something as minor as a squeeze on both sides of the phone. This activates an app or a camera. Pretty crazy technology. Lastly, we have the neon power button. It's plastic protrusion is held in place by\na little black flap. Not as ingenious as the buttons on the Nintendo\nSwitch, but with the long black plastic rod holding it in place, I have no doubt it will\ndo it's job well. I It's been a few videos since I've put a phone\nback together in working condition. I've had to break open the OnePlus 7 Pro and\nRed Magic 3 to get access to the heat pipes under the screens. But this Pixel 3a should go back together\njust fine. Getting the fingerprint scanners and two side\nwires attached to the underside of the motherboard is pretty much the hardest part. Then the whole thing can flop over underneath\nit's little plastic latch, and I can situate the headphone jack back in it's slot. One screw holds down the motherboard, then\nthe extension ribbons, squeeze ribbons, and battery ribbon all get plugged back in. Then the mid plate can come down and hold\neverything securely and structurally in place with it's 14 screws. The easy to replace screen gets plugged in\nnext to the motherboard through that mid plate. A brand new screen would probably come with\nit's own adhesive, otherwise you can just use thin double sided tape. And that's it. A fully functional Pixel 3a. I'm a fan of where Google is headed with this\none. A phone that accomplishes all of the essentials\nwhile keeping money in your wallet. What do you think about the Pixel 3a? Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

you to do is a force restart okay press and hold the power button do not let go until we see the Google logo appear okay so follow along with me here's the power button here ready 1 2 3 press and hold do not let go let's pretend that this screen is totally black I don't see nothing on the screen right now it's totally black I don't know what's going on I'm still holding onto the power button I'm

pressing in like this it's a possibility that you may have something that's disconnected inside your phone hopefully it's not an actual screen issue or a motherboard issue so press all over and now go ahead and turn to the back of the phone and do the same thing press firmly all over the phone okay you can see how I'm doing that all over around the lens area on the top corners here your fingerprint scanner press that in then let go and do the same thing with the power button press and hold one two three press and hold keep on holding do not let go that power button until we see that Google logo appear and hopefully after this step here your phone should be up and running if not we're going to move to the next step I'm still holding on to the power button I'm gonna go ahead let go now now if your phone still has a black screen next thing I want you to do is go ahead and grab your charging cable go ahead and start charging your phone plug the USB part into a computer or a wall socket or

bag put your phone into the freezer wait one hour after one hour take your phone out of the freezer take it out of the ziplock bag and then do the same thing again press and hold that power button wait for the Google logo to appear and if it's still not working go ahead and give the force restart a couple more tries and if it's still not working then your last option is to try and do a factory reset the only thing is with a factory reset you're going to lose all of your data on your phone so hopefully you have a backup I'll show you how to do a factory reset on your phone ok so basically is two buns that you want to press down press and hold down simultaneously at the same time ok so is the power button and volume down button ok press and hold both buttons ok one two three press and hold

this I mean you're gonna lose everything on your phone your photos videos it's basically going to make your phone as if you just bought the phone brand new and open it up out of the box so if you want to proceed with factory resetting your phone give it giving us a try then you would go ahead and select the power button select the power button then you get this message here and it says in red wipe all user data this cannot be undone okay so if you want to go ahead and proceed you would do the volume down to yes press the power button to proceed and then it's going to go through the process of rebooting your phone formatting and then once your phone is booted back up you're gonna get that hallo screen back in the beginning of course my phone is working fine so I'm just gonna go back up to

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, you are on HowFixit. \nIn this video guide, I'll show you   how to replace the motherboard \non your Google Pixel 3 phone. The following tools are required to \ndisassemble this Google Pixel 3 phone:  Screwdriver Set with Phillips 1, Standoff 1.5\nSuction cup  Plastic mediator\nPlastic pry tools  Tweezers\nAdhesive sticker And another useful tool is a magnetic \nproject mat. During the repair process,   don't worry about losing any screws and small \nparts, all of them will definitely remain on the   magnetic mat. Throughout disassembling the Google \nPixel 3, keep track of each screw and part so   you can put them back in the right places - \nthis will help successfully reassemble your   smartphone. In the description, I left links \nwhere to buy all the necessary tools and parts. Let's start disassembling the Google Pixel \n3 phone. First, turn off your smartphone.  Use a heat gun or hair dryer to heat \nup the surface of the back panel.  Apply a suction cup to the back \npanel and press down. Pull up on   the suction cup and insert the point \nof a plastic mediator into the gap.  Slide the plastic mediator across the phone \nframe to slice the adhesive, but do not push   the mediator into the case too much, so as not \nto damage the internal elements of the device.  Disconnect the battery cable. Use only the \nplastic tool to pry up from its socket.  If you need to replace the motherboard,   rear camera or charging port, you \ncan skip the battery removal step.  Remove the loudspeaker prying \nit up in a few different places,   but note - it still held in \nplace by an adhesive gasket.  Insert   the plastic tool under the motherboard and \ncarefully pry it up and then to the right.   Do not attempt to fully remove the motherboard. \nIt is still attached to the antenna cables.   Disconnect the rear camera from the motherboard.  In the description, I left a link where to \nbuy a motherboard for Google Pixel 3 phone. Before   you install   a   back   cover, let's check the phone. Check all the \nnecessary functions and how the replaced   module works. If everything works fine, go \nahead to the final part of the assembly.  Use isopropyl alcohol to clean \noff any remains adhesive.  Remove all adhesive residue   from the back cover.   Be careful using metal tools to scrape away \nadhesive it can damage the back cover coating.  Apply   new adhesive tape to the back cover.  If the back cover becomes unstuck from the phone \nframe, you can additionally glue the cover with   B7000 glue.\nThe   repair is over, you were on \nHowFixit, and see you next time.",

      "title": "Smashed iPhone XS Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge jeffries video in this video we're going to be restoring this iphone 10s this is a 256 gig model with a smash screen and back i purchased this phone from ebay for 335 australian dollars this was the cheapest broken one i could find at the time but i still believe it was overpriced that being said good working ones are selling at around 600 to repair this phone i have a new display adhesive a new piece of glass for the back and a new battery if you are doing a back glass replacement at home and don't have access to a laser machine you'll need to replace the whole housing i used to do this regularly but for this video i'm going to use the laser machine i was curious to see whether this phone actually had a cracked screen because it looked like it was just mostly the screen protector with all of the cracks so i removed it to find out unfortunately after removing the screen protector you can see it's still cracked underneath so we'll need to crack open this iphone by removing the two pentalobe screws from the bottom lifting up on the display with a suction cup and run our pick around the sides to separate the display from the frame there is some adhesive here which aims to keep out the dust and water but you can see i was able to slice right through it with the display opened i can remove the several tri-wing and one phillips head screw to gain access to all the connections we'll need to disconnect starting with the battery i can disconnect the display cables and the earpiece cable as well removing the front display panel we can get a closer look at the inside of this device i noticed quite a lot of dust inside so the water and dust resistant seal hasn't done its job regardless i'm going to remove the device's logic board while not strictly necessary when using a laser machine removing it can avoid the possibility of the laser cutting into the board if the laser template isn't aligned correctly there is only three screws securing the board in place however there is an additional 15 flex cables that need to be disconnected in order to remove it including two pesky ones right at the top the glue used to secure the glass sets like concrete unlike other brands of phones where the glass can be removed with a little heat the iphone needs lasers alternatively you could replace the whole housing having done it many times though i wanted to try it with lasers to compare the difficulty for this i'll be using a refox laser machine in the software i can select the brand apple and the template for the iphone 10s on the machine i'll focus the laser by placing the phone under the focusing probe afterwards the device can be placed underneath the laser using a red light will allow me to ensure the template is aligned correctly as it was large i resized it as best i could proceeding i can press the mark option to begin the process i have created a full video on this machine which i will link below if you're interested in learning more about the machine itself this whole process takes around 10 minutes with the laser passing over the phone twice this aims to disintegrate the adhesive underneath which will make it easier for us to remove the glass on top the more damage to the glass the harder it is for the laser to break down the adhesive below i've only attempted the laser back glass removal once the process went without any issues this time on the second run a small amount of flame started to come out of the phone i quickly stopped the machine at first i thought i must have hit the wireless charging coil but i believe it was just sparking on some exposed metal either way i thought this was a good time to stop and try and get the back glass removed as you can see after the process it's turned a frosty black color from here we can put it in a clamp and start getting this glass removed at first i tried a suction cup but that didn't seem to work so i decided for my point of entry i would just go from where the glass was lifting up from here i could get in a jimmy tool and start breaking away the glass compared to the iphone 10r that i did recently this did not come off nearly as easy maybe it could have done with another run under the laser as the glue felt a little bit stronger than the one on the iphone 10r but not only was it harder to remove it was also coming up in a lot smaller pieces this is mainly due to just how cracked the back was however to make matters worse we still need to get the glass removed around the camera lens see apple places the glass underneath the lens itself the glass we'll be installing actually has a bigger camera cut out meaning it will sit over top of the camera rather than going underneath it this is most doubtably the hardest part of the whole repair as the glass here is not only really hard to remove but the laser struggles to burn the adhesive around this area once we're done we'll need to place the device back under the laser machine so we can burn all of the remaining adhesive that's still on the frame we'll need to refocus everything and start the burning process once again the laser will need to pass over the housing twice just like it did before the first time nothing really happens but the frame turning a golden color the second pass is where you start to see the adhesive change color and lift up from the frame once it's completed we can scrape away all of the old adhesive it took four passes with the laser machine to achieve this this goes to show just how tough it is there is no way the adhesive needs to be this strong i thought i would attempt a custom back design however after printing it out on the laser it came out all pixelated even though on the software it was perfectly clear using the software to print just text it comes out perfectly fine i will need to find out what's causing this issue so i can reattempt this in the future i had attempted this before and it worked just fine however for this phone i'll just be installing an original back panel i can go ahead and apply the glue to the back of the phone the last time i did this i couldn't get the glue gun to work shout out to a commenter who figured out i just had the plunger in the wrong way with the glue applied i can place the back panel into place making sure it is lined up correctly and place a heavy object on it until it dries then i can remove all the excess glue that seeped out the sides with the back all ready to go it's time to turn our attention to the internals of the phone where i'm going to remove the speaker and taptic engine this will give us access to the battery adhesive tabs we'll need to remove to be able to get our battery out of place after disconnecting a sneaky little flex cable underneath we can remove both the taptic engine and speaker from there we can remove the adhesive strips these can be difficult to remove given they snap quite easily so you need to take your time and be careful when removing them i wasn't able to get the middle lower one out due to the flex cable that was right underneath it but i was able to pry the battery out without any issues from there we can reinstall our taptic engine and our speaker so we can continue reassembling the phone before i install the logic board i'm going to remove the front facing camera and face id assembly this will just make it slightly easier to reinstall our logic board into place as it's a few less flex cables that are going to get in the road when i'm trying to get everything seated down with the logic board in place there is now a heap of flex cables i'll need to connect as well as this bracket on the end fastening the two other screws we can reinstall that face id module connecting its appropriate flex cables into place as apple pairs each battery to every iphone i wanted to try and transfer its serial numbers to our new one i tried doing this using a jc pro 1000s however i wasn't able to write the new serial number as the battery wouldn't accept it however i will reprogram the display as well as that is another component apple is pairing on the phone failure to do this will result in the true tone function not working so i'll need to transfer the data using the jc pro 1000s from the old screen to the new one after burning the data it's important to read it back to ensure that it copied correctly with the software side of the screen ready to go it's time to get the hardware moved across the earpiece sensor will need to be transferred this is a vital component to the phone not only because it's the earpiece speaker but because it contains a module for the face id sensor if you damage this the face id will no longer function on the phone even if the cable is replaced it's now time to crack out our new display panel and get everything installed in the phone i'll remove this protective film and get our earpiece reattached after securing the three tri-wing screws our display panel is ready to go we'll need to clean up the frame before we can apply our new water and dust resistant seal it's important to remove all of this so our new seal makes proper contact with the frame after it was removed i used a cotton swab with some isopropyl alcohol to remove any dust and grime left behind i could then reinstall our new seal into place pressing it down with a spudger connecting up the display panel we can test out the phone to make sure that our new screen is working our new battery is functional and all the rest of the phone is still working after our laser treatment you can see in settings the battery health continues to load for a few minutes before displaying the battery not genuine message which is found on the iphone 10s and later now that we've confirmed the battery is working it's time to adhere it down into place after doing so we can get our display panel reattached after connecting the three display cables and the battery we can then remove the protective film across the battery and around the edges of the phone which will reveal the adhesive after which i can install the cowling back into place securing the four tri-wing and one phillips head screw after giving the inside of the phone a clean i can seal the screen back into position and reinstall the two pentalobe screws in the bottom of the phone all that's left to do is remove the plastic protective film from both the back and front of the phone and we're done so this is it an iphone 10s restored back into good condition we replaced the smash display and back panel as well as the old battery which had around 650 cycles and would be shortly nearing its end of life as batteries typically only last between 800 and 1000 cycles only after completing this project i noticed the display panel i have installed is an unsatisfactory lcd panel not an oled which this device should have the screen works although the viewing angles are poor not only compared to the original screen but also a good lcd screen the screen on this iphone is now also thicker than it should be running an lcd screen in a phone that wasn't designed for it can cause damage to the logic board as the phone is now driving an led backlight which it was never supposed to do i have ordered a refurbished oled screen for 108 dollars to replace this display the total cost including the new yet to arrive oled screen was 466 dollars and on that note this has been a huge jeffries video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration playlist for more videos just like this one and if you're looking for any tips or what tools i use to repair devices be sure to check out my website link for which is down the description

Unscrew 2 screws and remove metal panel. Unplug 2 camera cables and gently pry up the\ncamera module from the side and remove the camera. Unscrew 2 screws with a PH00 or PH000 screwdriver. Under one of screw there is the metal part,\nso do not lose it when disassembling the iPhone XS. Using a slotted screwdriver unscrew one screw\nand remove metal panel. Under the metal panel, there are 2 cables. It is difficult to get close to these two\ncables and it is impossible to turn them off with a plastic tool; therefore, using to metal\ntools, very carefully, disconnect these two cables. Now, pry up the motherboard and gently remove\nit from the iPhone XS case. The remaining cables you can remove and install\non new iphone cover, as well as buttons. However, it all depends on which cover you\nwant to replace. If you use for replacement original cover\nfrom any iPhone XS, then all the cables will be already installed. If you use copy of cover, then it will be\nneed to reinstall everything from original cover. But it all depends on each case individually. Before start the assembly, important stage... Let's start installing the motherboard. Install the mainboard and check that all cables\nare above the motherboard. Connect 2 cables to the motherboard.

Lightning port engage the suction cups and squeeze to open the phone. If you don't have a nice Glock handy a suction cup can be used in the same way. secured by both glue and clips so slide your pic along the top to separate the adhesive then gently wiggle the screen down in the direction of the lightning port try not to pull the phone too hard there are several cables connecting the display to the logic board and we don't want to damage it. remove the earpiece speaker and front sensor assembly to start peel back any tapes that might be covering the hidden screw in the lower right corner of the speaker assembly. process can take a bit of time but lucky for you we have an entire video walking you through the process we'll link to it down in the description below with your new adhesive strips applied position your display along the side of the iPhone and prop it up.",

      "title": "iPhone XS Screen Replacement",
      "transcript": "all right welcome and i hope you're doing well this video here i'll be doing a screen replacement on an iphone x s on a front screen here all right so let's get started the first thing i need to do is to remove the two screws at the bottom and again if you replace the screen you will no longer have the water resistant feature but if you buy the screen replacement that comes with uh some kind of like double-sided tape all around the corner then you might want to have to put it on so you would have the water resistant back again but for my case i'm not going to put that so after i replace the screen i will not have the water resistance feature anymore the reason why i'm saying that is because in order to get to the phone i'm using a prying tool and this prime two is actually cutting the double-sided tape so the phone is actually glue all around the corner and that would prevent the water getting in but to do the replacement on the screen you you actually have to cut the adhesive tape and that would you know stop the phone from being water resistant so i just wanted to point that out to you uh so that you would know what i'm talking about okay so uh just work your way around the phone to pry it open slowly and of course you need to make sure that try not to stick it too too deep in in the phone because that way you would you know actually damage whatever in in inside the phone i usually go right about this much okay so that is about this much of deepness and i'll cut all around the side of the phone okay so once you have that thing being cut as you can see when you lift up the phone uh you can see this little gooey tape here the black thing it's actually the water resistant uh feature okay so i'll leave some on the font so you don't have to remove entirely okay so the next step i'll be doing is to get the y screwdriver and go ahead and open up the bracket so the first three screws that i use are actually a wire screw and the one right here is actually the plus a regular phillips screw so they are different and there's one last here at the bottom that's for the y screw as well okay so this entire bracket will just come right out once you do that the first thing you need to do is to disconnect the battery so go ahead and disconnect this one here okay so this is for your battery now you can go ahead and disconnect the screen digitizer and the lcd cable here is for you to disconnect and just be careful because the flex cable there's a little you know double-sided tape that tip onto the flex cable you do not want to pull the cable and break it so you want to be gentle you want to separate away from the tape and there you go okay so as you can see i still have this you know gooey thing that is the full water resistant so whatever left over i'll just kind of put it back there at least you have some water resistant but not all of them i believe they do sell this tape you can buy them and then just put it back on if you want your phone to be water resistant again all right at this point here i already removed the screen okay so the next step i'll be doing is to transfer everything from here to the new screen replacement okay let's put the phone here on the side and go ahead and open up this new screen so you can see that the new screen does not come with this so let's go ahead and transfer this over to the new screen there's this little tape that is covering up the screw go ahead and scrape it off all right there you go there are three screws so i just removed all three of them the next thing you'll be wanting to do is be gentle i'm going to be slowly tuck it underneath what i'm trying to do is let me bring it closer to the screen what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to get underneath that cable right there so what you want to do is you want to go in you see that little stuff i wanted to do is to separate this cable okay and if you want you can remove the entire of this plastic as well because the new screen doesn't come with it so i'm just trying to get underneath tuck it in be gentle and slowly wiggle so hopefully you can get the entire piece out as in whole okay all right there you go so i'm removing this piece of plastic okay so this plastic is like a bracket that holds all these cables so you want to transfer this as well to the new screen like this okay and then you want to have this install back onto the bracket okay once you have that in place go ahead and close it down and once you close it down you should be able to see where the screw is going to go back on to right so it will align in the right position just like that okay go ahead and get the the y screw back onto the phone and then the tiny screw goes to the top left okay so once you have that in place let's move on to the next step is to go ahead and get the cable back on actually they're just like a lego so once you have them in the right position you press it you can feel like it's being snapped back onto so it's just like a lego um you cannot force it in you just gotta find the right sweet spot and it goes and it sits right back onto all right so i have all the three cables in place and finally i have the battery install okay so let's go ahead and turn on the phone obviously the screen looks okay to me i just need to be charged so i'll continue the repair by putting the bracket back on here so yeah the phone was dropped at the very beginning uh the phone wasn't working i can receive call i can hear the text messages i can hear the alarm goes off everything works but there's no screen um there's no display on the screen so i had to replace the screen and and this is the video i wanted to show you and share with you that um to do a screen replacement on an iphone x okay once you have that bracket installed the first thing i want to do is to align on the top here so go ahead and tuck it in first all right you want to tuck it in the top cover make sure you have them aligned in place and then slowly press it down on the side and it will just go right back on to it okay once you have that in place do not forget the two screws at the bottom all right so there you have it and i'll just go ahead and charge my phone and i should be having a brand new screen without any problem with it alright so i hope this video helps you if you have any question comment below and i look forward to make another video for you in near future thank you bye",

      "title": "How to fix &quot;update error&quot; on KaiOS or remove GerdaOS from Nokia 8110 4G using &quot;4bash&quot; from Recovery",
      "transcript": "Can't update your Nokia 8110 after installing GerdaOS? No problem! In this guide we will see how to repair our device in Recovery Mode. In the BACKUP section of our site we can access the REPAIR EVERYTHING section. From here it is possible to know the basic commands necessary and the tools we will need. First of all it is important to know how to read the \"logs\", stored in the cache. These text files are readable in several ways. The simplest is through a shell with ROOT permissions. After typing the debug code * # * # 3 3 2 8 4 # * # * I can start the root application. I am using ADBroot here, but you can also use Wallace-lite or Wallace Toolbox for this function. More information on the \"Temporary root\" page of our site. With the \"ls\" command we can find the list of files, while with the \"more\" command we can directly read the file that interests us. Generally, it is sufficient to read the \"last_log\" file. My phone has no problems, so I can't make you read any errors due to installing updates. You can take as a reference the photo that I uploaded to this guide, which shows an error in the system partition during the update. Before flashing partitions, you should definitely read the guide on the creation and temporary flashing of a Custom Recovery, with the related videos. 4bash.zip is a tool created by PurishNit, one of our best users. It is a zip archive executable in Recovery Mode, which allows the start of multiple operations simultaneously, listed in the script file bash4zip.sh. Without it, 4bash will not work. A 7zip archive dedicated to the Nokia 8110 that included 4bash.zip and bash4zip.sh, with a script already compiled for firmware version 13, it's available as example. Use only dumps related to your firmware version. In my case the firmware version is 17, the most recent. I can download the archive containing the clean dumps for my firmware version. In the 7zip archive there is also a \"new-dumps\" folder, in which you must arrange all the dumps of the necessary partitions. Make sure tha every listed dump is there. Read carefully the name of your files and their exact path. This script is dedicated exclusively to the Nokia 8110 4G. Using the \"ls\" command you can check the structure of your device and the exact position of the partitions (on which I have always written a guide in the BACKUP section). As you can see in the folder there are also a recovery.img and a custom Recovery based on the same file. For this I will perform temporary flashing manually. It is located in the new-dumps folder, so the command will be: dd if=/sdcard/new-dumps/recovery-testkeys.img of=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/recovery Take this command as an example in case you need to compile bash4zip.sh to flash other unlisted partitions. Warning! Do this every time you have a clean system partition! At the first start an internal script will restore the Recovery Mode to its original state. Never forget this rule! We can restart the phone. All we have to do now is to run the 4bash.zip file in Recovery Mode. I speeded up the video because the operation will take a long time, I'm flashing about 1 gigabyte of files. At the end of this operation we can restart normally from Recovery. I repeat: by reading the examples of how the bash4zip.sh script should be compiled you will be able to flash other clean partitions if needed. This way you can restore your phone to its original state using your clean dumps. I invite you to read the guides in the BACKUP section for more details. Thanks for your attention. See you next!

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S9 - How to Take Apart &amp; Replace LCD Glass Screen",
      "transcript": "hello there everyone in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to take apart and replace the glass LCD screen assembly on your samsung galaxy s 9 welcome to cellular pros in this channel we do tech reviews and tutorials so if you need to the channel I welcome you to subscribe all right guys let's go right to the video now okay so first off let's make sure that the phone is powered off if not then powered off next up we're gonna need to give it some heat and on the back cover with either a hairdryer or heat gun if you're gonna use a heat gun make sure to move around consistently not staying in one spot so that you don't burn the inside of the phone or you can set it on a hot plate which is what I prefer to use as I'm going to show you here and I set it to about 110 to 115 degrees Celsius and leave it on there for a few minutes until it's hot enough and keep in mind that we will have a link in the description where you can buy the parts and tools used for this repair so here's some of the tools we're going to be using we're gonna be using a suction cup I'm gonna be using some guitar picks so once you feel the phone is hot enough you may want to get it we can also use a folded business card as well as a prying tool alright so let's go ahead and get the phone while it's hot and we're gonna place the suction cup towards the bottom here and we're gonna give it some suction until we see a slight opening in between the glass and the metal frame of the phone so continue to pull up gently on the suction cup until you see a small separation opening up if you see that the phone starts cooling down don't be afraid to give it some more heat so that the adhesive loosens up more so as you can see now we're starting to see the separation here I'm gonna stick the guitar pick inside now and there we go so just gently push in the pic and once it's in there you can remove the suction cup so I'm gonna use the help of another pic here you can use as many as you want I'm gonna use this one to wedge it in on this side of the back cover so I'm gonna use a third pic here because I'm doing this very carefully we're gonna go slowly down each side with each of the pics but first I'm gonna give it some more heat as well to loosen up the adhesive so here we go now that I heated up two more I'm going to continue to go downwards on each side as you can see the pic is moving easier down the side so continue to work downwards and take your time don't rush it so you don't break the back cover if it's not broken once most of the back cover is removed you can start pulling up from the bottom and most of the adhesive will release and then next thing you may want to do is wiggle it around a little bit to release any leftover adhesive on there and the back cover will come off completely also remember to be careful with this flex cable that connects the fingerprint scanner to the phone so with the back cover now out of the way the next step is to remove the 15 small Phillips head screws holding on the back frame of the phone so with a small Phillips head screwdriver we're going to go ahead and remove that next next up we're gonna need to remove the back plastic housings here so we're gonna give them some pressure upwards you can do it with the prank tool or with your fingernail be careful with this antenna cable here for the wireless charger pull up on the plastic gently and it will come right out it might have some adhesive still holding it on but you can pull that right off so next up we're gonna pull up on the bottom part here which is the loudspeaker so we're gonna need to give it some pressure upwards as well and remove the adhesive holding it on there if the adhesive comes up a bit and just place it back down around the edges where it was before okay so once that is done next step is we need to disconnect the battery flex cable to stop any electricity from flowing through the phone then that's disconnect the LCD cable flex cable which you see right here if all you need to do is replace the LCD screen assembly then here you would have to heat up the old screen assembly here with the hairdryer again heat gun and once it's hot enough you're gonna pry up on the glass and LCD screen here and we're gonna pull it off completely so that we can place the new one in okay but let's go ahead and continue with this take apart tutorial so next up is we're gonna need to heat up the phone once again on the screen until it's hot enough so that we can pry up on the battery here and remove it completely next up we're gonna need to remove another Philips head screw here holding down the motherboard we need to go ahead and remove the SIM card tray if you haven't done so already so let's remove that now so now we can go ahead and disconnect the flex cable over here for the volume button disconnect the flex cable at the top for the front selfie camera and the this antenna connector down here as well which goes connected to the charger port let's go ahead and disconnect all of the antennas at the bottom connect it to the charger port once you have those cables connected we can go ahead and lift up on the motherboard let's take a prank tool under it like the guitar pick or you can wedge it up with your fingers as well so wiggle the motherboard around and it will come right out remember there's one more flex cable connected on the bottom the charger port connector so remove that and the motherboard comes out completely so next up we need to remove the charger ports so there's gonna be five small Phillips head screws holding it down so let's get the Phillips head screwdriver and remove those now once you have all the screws removed we need to begin pulling up on the charger port so we're gonna begin with this thin antenna cable here as you can see wedge something thin preferably plastic in between it to release the adhesive holding it down and it comes out just pull it out a little bit because it is attached to the charger port once you have that out we can go ahead and begin to pull up on the charger port giving it some pressure releasing the adhesive and also make sure to pull out the antennas from the brackets holding them down and last we're gonna need to pry up around the headphone jack area gently and it comes out completely in one piece and now let's go ahead and begin removing all of these small parts left on the frame so let's remove the front camera assembly here there's your front selfie camera let's go ahead and remove the ear speaker so with something solid it's going to pry up on it to release the adhesive and pull it out next up is the vibrator motor so we're gonna need a thin solid prying tool to get under it to be able to pry up and release it one more thing that we're gonna need to remove is this bracket up here this is for the proximity sensor and it comes off fairly easily and there we have it your Samsung Galaxy S 9 is completely taken apart so once you're ready just go ahead and place everything back together in reverse order so once you're ready let's go ahead and place the back cover back on the phone so first we're going to need to connect the fingerprint scanner flex cable so position it correctly on top of the connector and press it down until you feel it click there we go so that one connected and then all we have to do now is position the back cover right on top of the phone position the corners first so that it aligns correctly and then push it down on other sides give it some pressure so that it can glue back down to the housing of the phone please keep in mind that after doing this your phone's waterproof rating will not be valid anymore so this was just a quick video on how to take apart and replace the LCD glass screen assembly on your samsung galaxy s 9 alright everyone so that is it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give it a like it really helps the channel out a lot and as always I'll see you around in the next video peace Joe",

      "title": "Wrecked Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back from a huge Jefferies video in this video I'm gonna be completely overhauling this samsung galaxy s 9 plus with a cracked screen back and camera lens it also has a damaged camera module and dented frame this phone originates from the United States meaning it's a Snapdragon variant of the s9 while Verizon branded this phone is unlocked and can be used here in Australia but before we get started I'd like to thank I fix it for sponsoring this video get parts tools and guides at ifixit.com slash u Jeffries or at the link below to restore this Galaxy S 9 the tools I will use include a hot-air station and iFixit pro tect toolkit a magnetic mat to keep all of the devices screws organized and for the parts a replacement display frame back battery camera fingerprint reader and adhesive while quite an extensive list I want the device to be cosmetically brand new looking and fully functional with the use of a new battery and camera to begin I'm going to start with my hot air station and heat the back panel of the Galaxy S 9 this will hopefully soften up the adhesive and allow me to easily remove the back panel well though that wasn't the case given the amount that this phone has been shattered I did use a suction cup to try and lift up the back panel after hitting it however I was unsuccessful as it couldn't grip to the back good enough now applying some tape to the back of the phone will help a suction cup grip to the back better however I didn't have any spare tape around so I just wedged a Jimmy tool in between the frame and the glass however this can damage your frame so if you are only replacing the back or just a display then I wouldn't advise doing this but because I'm changing my frame anyway as it's quite dented and beaten up I wasn't too fast once you have the pic in place you can slide it along making sure to reheat when necessary you can also apply some alcohol to these pics to allow them to slide through the adhesive easier this is the hardest process of the entire repair and took me around 20 minutes just to remove this back piece of glass you'll need to be careful because there is a fingerprint reader cable connecting to the phone underneath so you'll just need to disconnect that when removing the panel after removing the back panel I would recommend cleaning your workspace as any remaining glass can scratch new components when we install them later on now I'm going to start by using some alcohol to clean up the camera lens because I want to see if I could repair it rather than have to replace the whole module but you can see even after cleaning there are these black blobs all over the camera picture so I'm going to need to replace that module later on but now it's time to disassemble this phone so I'm going to start by removing all of the screws holding in the wireless charging coil and speaker assembly luckily Samsung uses the same length screws for the wireless charging and speaker assembly so while I would still organize the screws if they do happen to become mixed up it won't matter for this section of the phone progressing further inside the phone I will start by disconnecting the battery to remove all power to the phone then I can remove the antenna cables to front-facing cameras and a flex cable for the LED indicator there is one screw holding the board in place which needs to come out then I can take out the SIM card tray and finally disconnect the charge port to be able to remove the board entirely from the phone next we can remove all of the smaller components inside the phone I'm going to start with the earpiece speaker and to remove that you're probably going to need a spudger or something to lift that up then I can take out the little divider piece between the two cameras and then I can take out this sensor cable which houses the LED indicator and I believe the ambient light sensor as well that is taped down in place but it doesn't matter too much if you damage that tape next I can take out the vibrate motor and that came out really easy actually compared to other Samsung's I have worked on furthermore we can move down to the lower half of the phone and remove the charge port assembly it's held in by a number of screws and then you basically just need a spudger to carefully remove it from the phone now it's time to crank out the new replacement frame that I'm going to transfer all these components into as well as install my new iFixit screen on this is a replacement OLED panel for the galaxy s 9 plus and as you can see it doesn't have a frame so we're going to need to attach that on to our new frame now if you wanted to reuse your old frame of course you can do that you just need to remove the old display but as mine was quite dented I opted for a new one as I wanted to make this phone as perfect as could be I'll need to install some new adhesive as well which will help the dust and water resistance of the phone it may not be as good as factory but it will definitely help stick the screen down and keep dust and water out of the phone you want to make sure you take your time with this and make sure it is aligned correctly so when the screen is sitting down you don't see any adhesive sticking out the sides it's time to come back to the iFixit display and remove this protective film over the adhesive on the back of the display this will also help adhere it to the phone so as you can see there is a significant amount of adhesive that goes on to this Galaxy S 9 to stick the two halves together I'll need to remove all the protective film on the frame itself and stick the panel down into place making sure it's aligned on all four sides now that the screen has been installed it's time to reassemble the phone starting with the small components such as the thermal transfer pad LED indicator air piece and the vibrate motor for those wondering I have found this phone quite easy to repair once you remove the back panel of the phone every component seems quite modular and very easy to install with very little screws other than the ones required to remove the charging coil and speaker assembly once I have the dock connector installed I'm going to open up my new packet for the replacement camera from iFixit and we can get that installed on the motherboard of the phone now Samsung glues the camera to the board itself so it can be a little bit daunting when removing this so I just used the flex cable coming from the camera to lift it out of place while this might damage the camera this one's broken anyway so I wasn't too worried about that with the new camera pressed into place and connected I can reinstall the motherboard into the once I have it correctly set it into position I can press down on the charging port cable to connect it I can then connect up the display antennas front cameras any flex cables and install the one screw I'm going to hook up a battery and quickly reinstall the speaker and wireless charging coil to make sure every function of the phone is still working pressing and holding the power button I successfully got a logo and everything was booting up as normal I could then run some quick tests off-camera to make sure everything in this phone is functioning from charging two cameras to the sound and vibration now that I can confirm everything was working I can flip the phone back over and give the speaker assembly a good clean with some alcohol as well as the charging coil to make sure to remove as much of that old adhesive as possible I can then install the speaker assembly and it screws back into place thankfully all the screws in this phone are Phillips drivers so I only need to use one bit from my pro tect toolkit I'm going to come back across to the old frame for a minute and just remove the old battery now the reason for this is there's actually a piece of rubber underneath which I'm going to need to take out and transfer across to my new frame this just helps the batteries seeped into place correctly so I want to make sure that is installed I will be installing a new battery in this phone to make sure that this can last more than a full day on one single charge so I'm going to transfer across this little black piece while not necessary it just makes the phone look original I'll also transfer across my IMEI number on the battery as well I can then remove the adhesive protective film and stick the new battery down into place installing the wireless charging coil again I can install its many screws holding it into place did you know any Galaxy phones newer than the galaxy s7 won't charge without their wireless charging coil installed as it now has an extra sensor to monitor the battery temp after the note seven battery catastrophe now we can install the new fingerprint reader and remove the protective films over the two camera lenses as it wasn't present I will install some adhesive for the fingerprint reader on backglass i'll also need to remove all the protective film before we can install it on the back of the phone correctly lining it up I can press it down into place making sure it is seated down properly to complete my repair I'm going to install a tempered glass screen protector which I ordered online upon pulling out of the box you can see this definitely isn't tempered glass and is in fact only plastic so I feel a little bit scammed here but regardless it will protect the glass on the phone however it won't be very durable as it will scratch quite easily given its plastic material this was quite difficult to install compared to a glass screen protector but it was all I had for the phone so it's going to have to do however in my experience plastic screen protectors are much better for the Samsungs as they can curve all the way around the display of course the downside to them is a fact that leaking develop bubbles and are really easy to scratch finally I can remove the plastic protective film from the back of the galaxy s 9 plus and we're done so this is it a fully restored purple Galaxy S 9 plus 64 gig us model for those wondering after replacing the chip to fingerprint reader the phone accepts the new sensor just fine as it's not paired to the phone in any way like some other brand of phone we all know in fact there's no components paired to the phone to stop people from replacing or repairing parts and with the use of only Phillips screws this device is quite repair friendly other than the strong adhesive on the back and on that note this has been a huge areas video if you liked what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration playlist for more videos just like this one also make sure to follow me on my

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus - How to Take Apart &amp; Replace LCD Glass Screen",
      "transcript": "hello there everyone in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to take apart to replace the LCD and glass screen assembly on your samsung galaxy s 9 plus hello everyone welcome to cellular pros in this channel we do tech reviews and tutorials so if you're new to the channel I welcome you to subscribe alright let's go right to the video now so let's get right into it first thing we're gonna want to do is make sure your phone is powered off if not powered off then let's go ahead and remove the SIM card and SD card tray up at the top with that out of the way now next step we're gonna have to heat up the back of the phone so we're gonna either heat it up with a hairdryer or a heat gun always move it around consistently never stay in one spot so that you don't burn the inside of the phone or you can also set it on a hot plate which is what I prefer to use and I set it to about 110 degrees Celsius and leave it on there for a few minutes until it's hot enough so once it's hot enough we're going to want to put some rubber gloves on so that we don't burn our hands we're going to be using a couple different tools a suction cup couple prying tools you may also use a business card if you don't have a prying tool so keep in mind we are going to have links down below in the description for all the parts and tools used in this repair so once the phone is hot enough you're gonna place the suction cup towards the bottom of the phone here until you see a slight opening once you see a slight opening we're gonna pry in there with a prying tool and squeeze it in there move around from side to side with the prying tool to remove the adhesive holding the glass to the back housing of the phone so continue to move around be very careful on the corners if the phone cools down make sure to heat it up a little bit more remember the heat is great for softening the adhesive that holds the glass to the phone you can use a business card folded in half and it creates a nice solid prank tool as well so let's go ahead and grab the phone and we're gonna go down on both sides with the prying tool it may use the help of other prying tools as well to hold it open continue to go down all of these sides of the phone until all of the adhesive holding down the back cover is completely removed then once you're ready go ahead and pull up on the back cover gently and be very careful because there is going to be the fingerprint scanner flex cable connected let's go ahead and disconnect that once disconnected you're safe to remove the back cover off completely next step we're going to need a small Phillips head screwdriver to remove all of the Phillips head screws holding the back frame of the phone to the housing once all of these screws are removed we're gonna go ahead and a pry in-between the wireless charger pad here with the prank tool to remove the adhesive holding it down and then we're gonna pry up on the plastic bezel to release the back housing of the phone let's disconnect the battery to remove any electricity from flowing through the phone and afterwards let's disconnect the LCD and digitizer cable which is this one right here if all you need to do is replace your LCD and glass screen assembly after disconnecting this cable you can go ahead and do that we can go ahead and heat up the front of the screen here we're gonna need to give it heat once again with hairdryer heat gun or set it on the hot plate and then you're just gonna begin to pry up on the LCD screen and glass with the prying tool like this and completely remove it and then you're just gonna place the new LCD and a glass screen assembly and fit they flex cable in through the small opening here on the side if you need to replace any other parts we're gonna go ahead and disconnect all of the Flex cables and antennas in order to completely take apart the phone so down here we're gonna have two small antennas connected to the charger port let's remove these move them out of the way and we're gonna have one small Phillips head screw right above the battery up here which we're gonna need to remove in order to lift up on the motherboard once you have that out of the way we can go ahead and lift up gently on the motherboard and it will lift up completely and then we're gonna go ahead and give it some pressure down here on the bottom charger port flex cable just push it downwards gently and it will disconnect from the motherboard move that out of the way so now we're gonna need to remove all of these small Phillips head screws here holding down the charger board once all of these screws are out of the way we're gonna begin to pry up on the Flex cables here for the motherboard gently pull them up they're going to be held down with so just a little bit of adhesive and it's gonna have a small antenna here on the side as well connected to the charger board with the screwdriver you can pull up on the headphone jack it will come out pretty easily and then continue to pry up removing the adhesive that's holding down the charger port and it comes off very simple next up we're gonna begin to pry up on the battery you can stick a prying tool down here and lift up on it and it will come off very easily and that's the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus completely taken apart and now you have to do is put everything back together in reverse order all right everyone so that was just a quick video on how to take apart to replace the LCD and glass screen assembly on your samsung galaxy s 9 plus did please give it a like it really helps to channel a lot so I took

      "transcript": "we have a samsung galaxy s9 so i made a poll not too long ago and you guys said you wanted to see whoa mcdonald's yeah so i made a poll not too long ago and you guys said you wanted to see more samsung repairs not really sure why i've done a bunch but hey anyway you guys know the drill we gotta cook this while we're cooking the ipad let's answer some q a questions what was the weirdest story you received for someone's phone i've had a lot of people come to me with stolen phones and working phones and asked me to switch parts from the stolen phone and the working phone and a lot of times it's really hard to tell if they're being honest or not i just kind of try and read their character and then do it if i think they're not lying to me if they're lying i usually turn them away when you aren't fixing stuff what do you like doing watching anime playing video games going to the gym i love going to the gym but my province has been locked down for like a year now so i was kind of out of the picture but i've been working out at home a little bit i don't really play video games i used to a lot it's just kind of a waste of time now uh i do watch a bit of anime though did you forget to put apart and just seal it i've done that a few times when i first started fixing phones just because i wasn't that good at it but for the most part i was fixing phones for my friends so they didn't really care too much but definitely put everything back where you found it it's not a good idea to leave stuff out while fixing someone's phone what is the weirdest message text notification that you saw pop up on the screen there's been a lot of sexual messages that pop up i kind of just swipe away and try and forget it that's probably as weird as it gets anyway enough q a let's get back to this repair gonna stick our pry tool in get our guitar picks by the way guys if you want to get this kit and fix your own phone the link is in the description so go check out the description i can't break this back class because i don't have any now i have to go pick up some backlash rush samsung repairs otherwise you're going to end up like me a few moments later and we got the new backlash i got i got the black one because this frame is black we can just rip this off now because it's of no use to us okay so we got our back glass off now we have to unscrew all these little screws this is pretty much the only time i ever use the wow stick it's an electronic screwdriver samsung just has way too many screws to do by hand so it's a lot nicer when you do it with the wow stick unscrew while i do this we'll continue the q a gordon ramsay 2 asks what was your worst fail at fixing a phone offer on camera this is kind of really embarrassing but when i first started i actually shorted someone's logic board and it was an honest mistake it just kind of happened i don't know how it happened to this day but it did thankfully they had the phone restored and they were trying to sell it so all i did for them was i went out and got them a new logic board and replaced it just karan asks what is your dream job and why you become a phone repair guru i became phone repair guru because i really like fixing stuff i've always been into technology ever since i was a little kid but my dream job actually was to become an ethical hacker and if you don't know what that is it's basically someone who hacks for good i always wanted to do that i was always really interested in that but i just never really happened for me nadgob73 asks is there part of the phone that you never had to replace i don't think i've ever placed anyone's volume buttons i think that's the one part of the phone that i've never had to replace we're just gonna disconnect everything remove the sim card unscrew remove the logic board and remove the charging port nero cyan asks what type of phone do you absolutely hate repairing i don't like the s5 i don't like the older versions of samsung i really hate ipads they're just way too much work it's just not a lot of fun vanessa asks how did you get into your profession and why i actually broke my phone i was about 16. i had an iphone 6 and oh oh that was really easy i was 16 i had an iphone 6 and it broke and i called a bunch of stores and they're giving me like crazy prices and at 16 i didn't want to pay those prices obviously so i just ordered a screen and i ended up fixing my phone i broke a lot of stuff but it kind of put me on this path i ended up breaking that phone a few weeks later i installed the custom apple logo mod on it and i shorted the board it was never to be seen again brie asks what is your favorite part about the job and how do you get glass slivers out i don't get them out they kind of just chill there until they want to leave by themselves i know it sounds really painful but it's honestly not as bad as you'd think my favorite part about the job is probably at the moment is making videos not gonna lie but before i used to just be uh seeing customers happy especially ones that have like important data on their phone they get really happy that makes me happy aside from that i genuinely just enjoy fixing stuff if you fix stuff you'll understand the satisfaction once you're done and it works is really fulfilling we're all done with this guy now it's time chill now it's time to reinstall everything onto our new refurbished screen there's pre-installed adhesive on this battery which is great but it keeps coming off with the seal now we can just slap the battery back in and we'll reinstall the charging port the headphone jack samsung keys making fun of apple whenever they change anything and then they copy them which is one of the things i don't understand they made fun of the headphone jack and then they took it away they made fun of the no charger and then they did the same thing lyanna asks what was your first mobile phone my first mobile phone was a samsung galaxy s4 it was way ahead of its time now it's obviously outdated but back then it was crazy samsung has so many hidden features on their phones that they don't really talk about i think they should do a little bit better with advertising because a lot of people don't really know half of samsung's features and if they did they would probably buy a samsung linux cj7 asks when high when how or why did you start recording your work i actually started it because of the pandemic i wasn't bringing people into my office because i couldn't it was illegal we had to do curbside pick up and drop off only so because of that i was like let's just record my stuff honestly i saw a bunch of garyvee videos i don't know if you guys know who that is and he was like pushing tick tock like crazy and i was like why not i have nothing else to do let's make it happen and then from there i started posting on youtube and here we are if you're ever fixing a samsung beware of these cables they're super annoying you have to put it in through the seam and then under the board a few moments later reinstall the front camera that was supposed to be smooth 2k murty asks what is the hardest device you've ever had to fix honestly this may come as a surprise to you guys but i'd say the ipod 4 is one of the hardest devices to fix sounds kind of ridiculous but they're really hard i don't know what it is it was not made to be repaired

My favorite part about the job is probably at the moment is making videos not gonna lie. i genuinely just enjoy fixing stuff if you fix stuff you'll understand the satisfaction once you're done and it works is really fulfilling. My first mobile phone was a samsung galaxy s4 it was way ahead of its time now it's obviously outdated but back then it was crazy. samsung has so many hidden features on their phones that they don't really talk about i think they should do a little bit. better with advertising because a lot of people don't really know half of samsung's features and if they did they would probably buy a samsung linux cj7 asks when high when how or why did you start recording your work. i actually started it because of the pandemic i wasn't bringing people into my office because i couldn't it was illegal. i've never seen a carrot i've never met one in real life and i don't plan on it i have a caring radar in my office so if a caring comes it goes off and i kick them out that's just how it works. i was really scared like it was it was interesting and i was excited but i was definitely really scared because i didn't know what to expect. didn't get any training youtube was my training there's no schools to do this kind of stuff as far as i know it's kind of something you have to teach yourself anyway guys that is all for today we got this s9 fixed uh i don't recommend you guys diy the s9 or any samsung phone to be honest it's not worth it you could break a lot like me break the back glass whatever.",

      "transcript": "the Samsung Galaxy S 9 has been out for six months now that's plenty of time to drop it crack it plunge it into the water or just have the part go bad that's why we enlisted our friend Ryan Braun Dyk of cell medic phone repair to pull one apart show you what's inside and how to put it all back together again tools needed for an S nigh and repair are tweezers a double-0 Phillips head screwdriver a razor blade a flexible thin metal pry tool sim card removal tool plastic spudger playing cards or guitar picks a heat gun or heating pad and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol first step is to remove the back glass this requires a lot of heat to cut through it's strong adhesive enough that the phone is almost too hot to touch and while you want to give it a good even blast avoid heating around the back camera which may ruin the delicate hardware inside start prying from the bottom of the phone with a razor or a thin metal pry tool don't start at the top which we'll get to in a second and don't insert your prior tools too deeply as you get separation between the glass and the frame insert playing cards or guitar picks to keep the gap open and keep throwing on the heat this adhesive is strong stuff and it cools quickly so don't rush once the glass separates completely from the frame do not lift it up right away as you can see here the fingerprint sensor is still attached to the body sneak inside there and unclip that first before pulling it away from the back glass if you're repairing the back glass or the fingerprint sensor the original parts can be separated with a little heat and elbow grease give the sensor some heat and pry it out a new sensor can be installed on the original glass or a good sensor can go on to new glass the charging coil on loudspeaker are the next things to go these parts are held down by 15 Phillips head screws once these are out pick out the charging coil followed by the loudspeaker if you forget to remove the SIM card tray and that was a good time to pop that out too before you do anything else detach the batteries push connector to remove the battery itself you'll need a couple things heat and isopropyl alcohol since the battery adhesive has no pull tabs your only option is to pry it up and heat is generally your best friend in that scenario but a few drops of alcohol do wonders to weaken the adhesive and may praying about a thousand percent easier if you have a new battery pop it in with some new adhesive and you're good to close the phone now the logic board is all open start detaching things like the front camera assembly and the volume flex cable then the display cable the signal connector and the two other antennas at the bottom near the vibrate motor is one more Philips head screw holding the logic board down once that's gone pull the board out from the top and detach it from the charging port assembly at the bottom notice the back camera poking out of the middle of the logic board it's attached from the underside by a wide push connector and is easily replaced remove the headphone jack next by popping at the push connector and removing the one screw holding it down insert tweezers or a screwdriver into the jack to push it up and out four screws are left holding the charging port in place once removed the prying begins this is the squiggly a' start of the s9 so be patient and start by freeing the antennas wrapped around the battery compartment and the extension ribbon that falls into the mid frame next the cylindrical vibrating motor pops out without a problem slightly more difficult is removing the proximity sensor which is covered in a heat conductive copper tape if you're replacing the screen on the s9 this may be as far as you want to take it full frame assemblies are available for purchase that make any additional teardown unnecessary however if you want to keep your frame you can continue to remove the front screen use in the same process you did on the back glass that means a loss of heat and lots of pride for the purpose of this video we'll start the rebuild here well reinsert the charging port first and fold that down placing the antennas in the same place who found them which the headphone jack into its compartment then screw it all into place replace the proximity sensor fold the copper tape down flat then replace the vibrating motor attach the logic board to the charging port and lay that down flat so it doesn't cover any connectors reattach the volume flux cable antennas and display cable and reinstall the front camera the battery can go in and connect clasp and don't miss that last screw near the vibrator motor lay down the charging coil and loudspeaker preferably loudspeaker first at the bottom snap into place and drive in all 15 screws the back glass is all this left reattaching the fingerprint scanner is a challenge and requires a good feel for when the push connector is in place if you're performing a repair you would use new adhesive on the back glass to keep the phone firmly sealed a last pass with the heat helps set the adhesive and with the SIM card tray and reinstalled you're good to go the s9 doesn't hold many surprises for anyone familiar with the s8 be patient pulling up that back glass and remember about that fingerprint sensor if you enjoyed this video please

      "title": "iPhone X Teardown! - Screen and Battery Replacement shown in 5 minutes",
      "transcript": "It's time to tear down the iPhone X. This video will show the basic screen replacement,\nalong with how I swap out the uniquely shaped battery inside of Apple's newest flagship. Accidents happen, and things wear out and\nbreak. So it's good to know to how get things back\nup and running. Let's get started. Getting into this phone is pretty similar\nto the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8, but it does get a bit easier once you are inside. The same familiar two pentalobe screws are\nat the bottom of the phone. I'll have a little tool kit linked in the\nvideo description for you, along with all the parts needed to complete these replacements. After getting these two screws out, I like\nto warm up the screen a little by softening the ip67 water-resistant adhesive under the\niPhone 10 display. I'll use a suction cup and a pry tool to lift\nup on the glass a little and get my metal pry tool between the plastic edge of the screen\nand the metal edge of the frame. Then I can slice along the edge of the phone,\njust underneath the glass, to detach the rest of the adhesive. When the screen is mostly free, it doesn't\npull down this time to unlock, but instead just folds right open like a book. The ribbons you see on the right side of the\nphone are extremely fragile, so don't put any pressure on them. Apple did simplify the process with only one\nmetal bracket this time, which is nice of them. Still using the same y triple zero screws\nas previous iPhones. I'll remove the 5 screws holding that metal\nplate down and then keep them organized off to the side because they definitely need to\ngo back in the same hole they came out of. It was also nice of Apple to put all the connectors\nin one solitary row for us here in the center. The connectors we care about during this video\nare first, the battery connector. Making sure to use a plastic pry tool when\nlifting this off as to not short out the battery. Then we can detach the two screen ribbons,\none at the bottom right, and the other at the bottom left side of the connector row. And the last guy is for the earpiece and microphone. This also detaches like a little Lego from\nthe motherboard. And here is the screen. Quite a bit simpler design now that we don't\nhave the fingerprint scanner at the bottom. These OLED displays are definitely going to\nbe more expensive than the LCD iPhone screens of the past just because the part itself costs\na lot more. I'll have the current pricing in the description\nlike always. It does fluctuate with time and will get cheaper\nas the phone gets older. The new screens will probably not come with\nthe earpiece attached, so there are 3 more screws when you transfer over. I'll pull these out, being careful to keep\ntrack of the little gold niblet on the top screw. Then I can fold the speaker down and away,\nallowing me to pull up the microphone and the other small sensors. These ribbons are extremely fragile, so go\nslow and be careful. Now that I have the speaker out, it really\ndoes depend on how the new screens ship, but you might also need to transfer over some\nof the clear plastics, but that's not too big of a deal. Historically, Apple has not made things easy\nfor people trying to fix their own phones. With the old error 51 and fingerprint scanner\nhardware issues, they've made things pretty complicated. But with this screen we shouldn't have any\nissues. All of the phone's face unlocking hardware\nis still tied to the phone and not a part of the display, so thumbs up for that. With only the display and digitizer connectors\nleft on the screen, we should be safe. I'll put the screen back together before jumping\nonto the battery replacement portion of this video. It's pretty straightforward with all of the\nsensors going in the same slots they came out of and then the earpiece speaker folding\nover back on top of them. There's the three y triple zero screws holding\neverything in place. Make sure to get that gold niblet back on\nthat center screw. I'm not sure exactly what it does, but it's\nprobably important. Remember, the display is one of the most expensive\nparts of this phone, so be nice to it. Now let's take a shot at removing the oddly\nshaped battery. Since the screen is already off and the battery\ndisconnected, I'll grab the first magical pull tab at the top of the battery and slowly\npull it out from underneath. These are very fragile, so go slow, plus that\nsound is delicious. At the bottom of the battery there are 3 more\nstubby pull tabs. These are hard to get at, but if you have\na pair of wide tip tweezers, that would be ideal. With my needle tips I'll just grab the edge\nand then pull it out as best I can with my fingers. If you do fail at pulling out the magical\npull tabs, you'll have to commence the Pry of Shame. Another trick that might help out is to grab\nthe tweezers and twist the pull tab around the tip of the tweezers to get a better grip. And now the battery is out and this is the\nmost unique battery I've ever seen inside of a cellphone. Kind of interesting design choice. Hopefully the replacements aren't too expensive. Like always, I'll have them linked in the\nvideo description. Below the battery we can see the wireless\ncharging and the metal frame of the phone. If you're replacing your own battery, you'll\nwant to use some double sided tape to keep things from jiggling around. Personally, I'm going to be opening this phone\nup more in the future, so I'm skipping my adhesive for now. With the battery in place and the 3 ribbons\ncoming from the screen I'll reattach to that center connector bridge, I can finally plug\nin the battery. It goes in last just to be safe. I'll test the phone out before adding that\nmetal plate just to make sure everything is working. If there are lines going through your display,\nor it's gray, or nothing shows up, it might just be a bad connection. Re-seat those little Lego connectors and try\nagain. My phone is turned back off and the metal\nplate slides into place with it's five screws. All of these are different sizes so they need\nto go back in the same hole they came from. Finally the phone can fold shut just like\na little book and clip down into place. And everything is still working. I'll toss the bottom two pentalobe screws\nback in and it's ready to go. If you enjoyed this video, or if it helped\nyou out, hit that subscribe button and come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram. Let me know in the comments if you have any\nquestions. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

      "title": "iPhone X Screen Replacement—How To",
      "transcript": "The iPhone X is Apple's most breakable phone yet, which means you're probably gonna crack your display at some point. Apple wants to try to charge you almost $300 to fix it for you, but I've got a way that'll save you some dough. Today I'm going to show you how to replace the display, and I'll show you how to maintain face ID when you make the swap. Remember that by opening your device, you are losing water resistance, so be sure to apply new adhesive to your display when you reassemble your phone. We'll have a link to that guide in the description below. For this repair, you're going to need: a P2 pentalobe screwdriver, a, tri-point Y000 driver, a spudger, tweezers, an iOpener, an iSclack, and opening picks. Start by removing the strangely long P2 pentalobe screws by the lightning connector. Next use an iOpener to soften the adhesive on the edge of the phone. This will also help you insert an opening pick to cut away the adhesive. Once you get to the side with the power button, be careful. The display connectors reside on this side, and going in too deep with your pick can damage them. Go all around the phone, making sure you cut away the remaining adhesive. The iPhone X still opens up to the right, just like the iPhone 7 and 8, but all the connectors are now under one bracket to rule them all. Go ahead and remove those five tri-point screws and lift the bracket away with your tweezers. Grab your spudger and pray to the cable gods that you disconnect the right cables. Just kidding, I'll show you where to start. Start by disconnecting the battery. It's the third one up from the bottom. Then disconnect the three display connectors. It's easier if you just follow the cables to its connector on the logic board. With all the connectors disconnected, you can remove the old display. To retain face ID you must swap over the original front sensor assembly to your new display. Moving on to the top of the display, remove the wide 000 screw near the infrared camera port. Beneath that screw lies a small metal grounding clip. If it didn't come out already with the screw, go ahead and remove it. Next remove two more wide 000 screws holding the speaker and sensor assembly down. Using a spudger, gently pry under the top edge of the speaker, assembly, and flip it over down and away from the top edge of the display. Just be careful because the speaker is still attached via a thin cable. Heat up your iOpener and lay your display over it near the top. This will soften the adhesive securing the sensors. Carefully, slide the flat edge of your spudger underneath the flex cable below the microphone. Then twist gently to separate the microphone while being careful not to strain or damage the flex cable. If needed, use the point of the spudger to finish separating the microphone from its notch on the front panel. Grab a pick and slide it under the flex cable and proximity flood illuminator. Work the pick left to right carefully. Gently wiggle and lift to separate the module from the front panel. Using tweezers, wiggle the ambient light sensor and lift it from it's notch on the display. With the entire ambient light sensor un-adhered, you can remove it from the display. If you've successfully removed the entire ambient light sensor then you're all good for now, but if the white diffuser strip detached and stayed in the display, then you need to carefully dig that out. That's all for this repair. Be sure to click that subscribe button so you've got the latest repair and teardown videos in your back pocket for your next fix. I'll see you next time.",

      "title": "iPhone X Screen Replacement Done Correctly",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back from a huge Effy's video in this video I'm gonna be repairing this iPhone 10 which is in need of a screen replacement while it's only suffered minor damage the screen is constantly glitching and tends to have a mind of its own while not a difficult repair many third-party repair shops perform this repair inadequately but will get a little bit more into that later on but before we get started I'd like to think I fix it for sponsoring this video right now you can take $10 off orders of $50 or more with the code fixmas 10 so upgrade someone's toolkit for the holidays or treat yourself just visit I fix it calm / you Jeffries or click the link below now I purchase his iPhone at the beginning of the year for $400 at that time it was the 2nd newest iPhone on the market however it's now a little bit older as I haven't got around to repairing it but what I received in the package was literally just the iPhone itself with no other accessories taking it out of the box I could power it on for the first time and verify everything was working and given that the true tone feature is still active it is most likely that the display has never been replaced on this phone once the phone was set up I did notice it was on a beta version of iOS 12.3 and was constantly coming up with the message to update the beta version so to remove that I just restored a stock version of iOS 12.3 onto the device which was the latest version at the time now to fix this phone properly I'm going to need a couple of items obviously I'm going to need a replacement display as well as the correct adhesive and also a reprogramming unit to reprogram the serial numbers in the display I'll talk a little bit about why that's necessary later on but the first thing I'm going to do is power down the iPhone and carefully remove the two pentalobe screws from the bottom it's important to go slow and be gentle with these as a very small and easy to strip I can then use an eye opener tool to heat the bottom of the display and using a suction cup being able to lift it up and then insert a pic underneath and gradually move around the edge of the display as the display is adhered to the frame it takes a little bit of prying to get it up but once it is removed we can then take out the few screws holding in this bracket which will reveal a whole number of flex cables the first thing you'll need to do is disconnect the battery to make sure that you don't fry anything internally while working on the phone I can then disconnect these screen cables as well as the front earpiece removing the display from the iPhone we can bring it across to my programmer now you can pick various numbers of programmers online so do your research to find the best one for your needs now what I'm going to do is read the old screen data and then make sure that it's saved to the device I can then disconnect the old broken display and connect up our new iFixit panel and reprogram at that display now in my case I'm going to be reprogramming it on the JC Pro 1000s however this company also makes a few other ones that are slightly less expensive either way I can then burn the data on to the new screen which basically transfers all of the serial numbers and data from the old display over to the new one the reason for this is to retain the true tone function on the display as everything in the iPhone is basically paired to each other failure to reprogram certain components can cause limitations on the phone itself now once we've reprogrammed the display I can remove a couple of screws and take the earpiece assembly off of the old display and transfer it across to that new iFixit panel this is actually a lot easier to do than previous generations of iPhone as well as the fact that doesn't have a home button so there's even less things needed to transfer across however when reassembling make sure to connect the gold grounding clip and align it correctly now that our display is prepped and ready to go I'm going to test fit everything and make sure the phone is functioning now whilst I've reprogrammed it I need to check the true tone function is working if it is missing from settings that means the reprogramming part was unsuccessful as mine is functioning perfectly I can then remove the display and continue with the repair I'm going to need to remove all of the old adhesive that was holding down the display and I can do that by twirling around my spudger and moving all of the old adhesive being very careful of the face ID sensor as that's also another paired component however only Apple is able to reprogram it so if damaged you will lose face ID capabilities I can then come along with some alcohol and give it a good proper clean now that the two halves are prepped it's time to seal them together and that can be done with the new water-resistant seal which will need to be applied between the two halves many third party repair shops missed this step along with reprogramming the display resulting in a very poor repair once we've flattened down the seal with a spudger I gave the camera a bit of a clean as it appeared to have a fingerprint on it which could have been from the factory or even a previous repair I can then attach the new iFixit display panel back on to the iPhone making shorts you firmly attach all of the Flex cables and then finally connect up the battery reinstalling the one bracket and its few screws I can then finally give the inside of the phone one last clean and then remove the protective film over the adhesive strips so they're ready to be sealed down once all the adhesive strips have been removed we can start to reinstall the new panel onto the phone starting with the top and being very careful on the right hand side where the cables are we can then press down the display firmly into place and reinstall the two pentalobe screws into the bottom of the iPhone we can then remove the protective film and we're done so this is it my iPhone 10 is now back into working condition and is no longer glitching out all the time while not a difficult repair to complete you do need to have the right equipment like a pro Tek toolkit which has the pentalobe and trialing pieces that these iPhones contain as well as a reprogram er to be able to properly reprogram the display and do the repair job properly jumping into settings this is a 64 gigabyte iPhone 10 running iOS 12 point 3 and as you can see the true tone function is still functioning just fine after the screen replacement however if you don't reprogram the display this function will entirely disappear from the phone with the display replaced this phone is in very good condition however it does have some lights scratches on the back from the previous owner and on that note this has been a huge air freezer video if you like what just saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone restoration playlist for more videos and just like this one also make sure to follow me on my social media link for which is down in the description that's all for this video and I'll catch you guys

      "summary": "The iPhone 10 is in need of a screen replacement while it's only suffered minor damage the screen is constantly glitching and tends to have a mind of its own. I'd like to think I fix it for sponsoring this video right now you can take $10 off orders of $50 or more with the code fixmas 10. It is most likely that the display has never been replaced on this phone. To fix this phone properly I'm going to need a replacement display as well as the correct adhesive and also a reprogramming unit to reprogram the serial numbers in the display. being able to lift it up and then insert a pic underneath and gradually move around the edge of the display as the display is adhered to the frame. Once it is removed we can then take out the few screws holding in this bracket which will reveal a number of flex cables.

      "transcript": "I bought ten very broken iPhone tens let's see if I can fix them now before we start fixing these I do need to set some expectations first of all there's a good chance that most if not all of these are iCloud locked and not actually usable now I am hoping that there's going to be a few that are not so we can actually fix some that are usable but I did buy these in a salvage lot which means there's no guarantees on anything I am NOT an iPhone technician I've repaired a few iPhones in the past probably like one or two per year so I'm a little bit familiar with some repairs but I've never done anything like the iPhone 10 I've never done any of the newer phones so the reason I did this is basically just to get better at repair I'm a game console repair technician but I want to learn how to fix other stuff as well so that's why I bought this lot of 10 iPhone tens so this is my attempt at getting better represent a 'king you along for the ride let's get started now the first thing we do need to do is just kind of take an inventory of our phones here and see what we think might be fixable what might not be and then we'll have to plug them in and see if any of them turn on I know nothing about the condition of these phones other than what we see here obviously most of them have a cracked front and back screen but I don't know anything else about these so I'm gonna plug them in one by one I'll make some notes on them so we know what we need to fix and then we'll see if any of them are fixable and any of them are actually usable when they are fixed now I paid one thousand six hundred and seventy dollars for all of these iPhones so that comes out to one hundred and sixty-seven dollars each great news on this first one we actually see an Apple logo woah look at this okay let's see so far great news on this one let's check and see if Find My iPhone is um looks like it's not set up so great news on this first iPhone 10 I don't think it's locked I'll have to check the carrier lock and see if there's any carrier lock but the Find My iPhone is turned off so great news so far hopefully we can get more like this one this one's gonna be a problem frames broken here broken their back glass is shattered hopefully not too much damage up here definitely got some problems also it doesn't turn on doesn't get warm so we're gonna have to check into this one a little bit more no power on that though so no power on iPhone number three oh hey here we go we got a Apple logo what are the chances of this touchscreen even works well the touchscreen does work Wow so far i phone number four actually looks like maybe it'll work still have to check if it's blacklisted or anything but so far it looks good I mean looks good as in it's not iCloud locks so far we definitely do have a bent frame on this one shattered front glass the back glass so far actually looks pretty good which is amazing but it doesn't do us too much good since the frame is bent but still could be a lot worse than number four looks good so far and here we go with iPhone number five this one is also just shattered Apple activation lock it looks like so that's not good news but let's see if it turns on so iPhone number five definitely doesn't turn on no signs of life and number six has no power as well let's move on to number seven number seven I don't know what that's from but that definitely does not look well we actually have a battery signal on it I'm not even sure I should be plugging this one in with the looks of that but I can't believe the screen actually turned on for a second number seven we'll definitely have to take a look at before we do too much messing with it because this definitely doesn't look good but it did turn on for just a second oh here we go look at that it actually just needs to charge up I I think I'm still gonna take it apart more just to see how it looks on the inside because this definitely can't be good I'm afraid maybe there's some motherboard damage or possibly even the battery so I'm not gonna put any more power into it than I have right now just because I really don't want it to start on fire and here we go with iPhone number eight we've got a Apple logo good news okay and here we go oh this is no good an update is required to activate your iPhone I'll have to look into this most likely this one has been locked but we'll look into that one a little bit later and just a reminder I am NOT an expert on fixing iPhones I know very little about fixing iPhones I've replaced a few screens a few batteries here and there over the years but nothing is new as the iPhone 10 so if you guys have any ideas of what might fix these be sure to leave a comment and let me know what you think and maybe I can revisit them at a future time let's move on to iPhone number 9 and number 9 does show power on the screen but unfortunately the screen is in too bad of shape we can't do anything so we'll need to try this with a new screen to know whether it's iCloud locked or anything like that it did buzz just now so I am hopeful and iPhone number 10 great news so far ok Oh unfortunately the touchscreen does not work on this one so we won't know any more about this until we put a working screen on it so there you have it we have the very first diagnosis diagnosis whatever we know what was wrong with most of these at least initially so now it's time to order some parts and everyone's favorite part it's time to take them apart I'm gonna start with number one the one that has Find My iPhone turned off hopefully we can actually make this into a working iPhone so let's start with that one and see if we can get a quick win this one definitely needs a new back glass and it's got a mark on the screen and a mark up in the corner so it doesn't need a new front screen as well and then I want to use this screen to test some of the other iPhones that have faulty screens so with iPhone number one the first thing I'm going to do is try and get all of the shattered glass off the back now keep in mind all the parts and tools I use and all of my videos are available in my Amazon store with the link down in the description below this is an affiliate link so I do get paid Commission whenever one buys something from Amazon using my link so the back glass on these iPhones is incredibly difficult to remove let's try this first and see how it goes so you can see I am getting it in little chunks but it's just taken forever it's just ridiculous and even then a lot of the adhesive isn't coming off with the glass I have to scrape it off separately also you can see the condition of this back case from all the scratching I mean it's not bent or anything but it's just scratched up like crazy so this is definitely not a good way to go probably just get a new entire rear housing it takes a little while to replace all the guts into the new housing but it's a way better option than doing it this way now I have to wait for the parts to get here for that so we'll move on to the next iPhone let's check out iPhone number 2 it has no power so let's see if we can figure this one out it's another white one but it also has a broken frame right there so let's see if we can figure this one out okay there we go iPhone number one we have the screen off just need to remove this bracket and then we can get it all the way off now with the screen for my phone number one we can hook it in to number two and see if number two a power on bummer so it looks like iPhone number two is still dead I'm gonna take some more parts see if maybe the motherboard is cracked just from this it could have cracked a logic board on it so let's take it down more and see if we can figure out why it won't power on at all now first things first let's see what kind of voltage this battery has on it my meters saying three point zero nine six so just over three volts it needs to be three point eight one so the batteries definitely discharged but it doesn't make any noise or anything when we plug it in to a charger so I'm assuming it's more than just a battery issue and here we have a battery tester it is definitely discharged but according to this the battery voltage is three point zero nine seven so we were reading it correctly I'm just looking at this I don't think the logic board on this is bent or broken if you can see the logic board goes up to about right here or so and the main Bend is right here so I mean that could have bent this very end but I don't think that would cause it to not power on so I'm kind of wondering if maybe we have a problem down here in the dock area now I do know that I have some good docks on these so I might swap the dock out with another one just to see if that gets it working now we know that number eight powers on but it is unable to activate so since I can't activate this one anyways the first thing I'm going to do is take it all apart and use this one for parts so I'm going to swap the dock from number eight into number two and we'll see if that gets number two working hey we got it okay no this whole battery comes out hey there we go and now we have the battery out Wow look at that the dock ribbon cable goes under the motherboard right there well I guess we're taking this one apart anyway so let's get the motherboard out and get this whole entire dock ribbon cable out so here we go the motherboard for number eight is loose okay so the dock connector is this one right here okay dark connector is now loose I hope I didn't ruin the ribbon cable here that's extremely difficult to get out from under those two machined pieces into the side case I think everything is okay though I'm gonna try unplugging the dock connector from here and plugging this dock connector in yes discharged battery okay this is great news this means I think it means that we just need a new dock connector in this I don't know for sure as I'm not an iPhone technician but so far this looks like it might be good news I'm gonna try letting it charged up for a little bit and see if we get any picture on the screen there we go Apple logo so just to be sure I plugged a dock connector for this iPhone back in and it actually shows the Apple logo now so I'm not convinced the docks in that connector is actually faulting I'm gonna let it charge for a little bit and see what we get so for iPhone number two I was able to get it to connect to itunes it's supposedly downloading an update right now so hopefully that one will work for now we're gonna move on to iPhone number three an iPhone number three has no power so let's see why not and so the screen is not even connected so I think what I'm going to do is connect a known-good screen right now so then we can tell whether it's a screen problem or not and here we go let's see what happens okay we've got battery charging symbol that's good news while number three is charging let's check out number four the notes from the diagnosis say it turns on that seems to work I need to finish setting up and test it more to see if there's any other problems well so far so good on this one this one we just got an Apple logo so we'll see what happens here okay great news here so far and also this one's looking good okay so number three does have power but the digitizer on this screen is broken so I can't check the rest so we'll need to get another screen on this one to be able to check that let's go back to number four and see if it'll continue setting up and if there are any locks or anything on it so iPhone number four is set up with my account and everything looks good on I will make sure that it's not carrier locked by someone not paying their bill or something like that but so far iphone number four looks great I mean other than the screen and the back case actually looks amazing but unfortunately it's broken right here so I'm gonna go ahead and put a new back case a new screen on this and get number four looking nice but before I do that I'm gonna use this screen on number three to see if we can get that one set up and working as well all right now I have the working screen from number four in number three let's see what happens all right Oh touch still doesn't work okay that's a bummer and this is the screen I was just using on number four so first thing I'm gonna do is check out those connectors and see if there's any problems there and then we'll go from there alright it didn't verify this is the digitizer connector so that's the part we need to inspect now let's take a look under my microscope see if we can see any problems here so just looking at this connector I don't see any problems at all there's a little bit of like gunk right here and maybe a little bit right there this part has been bumped right there that component but overall I don't see anything wrong right now to really test this we would need to take all this black gunk off here and test to these these components so for number three with no touch I did some looking around on number three and I found a video by Jesse Jones and if any of you don't know who Jesse Jones is she's an amazing iPhone and iPad repair person she has a YouTube channel I highly suggest it if you're trying to fix something on an iPhone and you get stuck or even if you're just trying to learn a little bit more about iPhone repair but she has a video about this very same problem and shows how to diagnose it so I'm gonna get under the microscope and show you what I found so the way justice said to diagnose this problem was to put red probe on ground this is using diode mode and if you test this first pin here it should be at 0.41 and this is the known good board so it does show 0.41 and the next one i think is about the same yeah 0.41 so now we're gonna go to the board that does not have touch so now let's look at this board we're gonna go to the same locations red probe on ground and check the first pin and see what kind of reading we get see how we have that oh L open line that means there is no connection between that pen and where it's supposed to connect same with the next pen so the problem with iPhone number three is the logic board on this it has three layers and unfortunately the readings that we got means that there's a break between two of those three layers or maybe all three layers in the main lines between the chip that gives the touch power and the touch connector itself so unfortunately this is one that I'm not going to tackle I don't have the tools the knowledge or the patience to do something like that so unfortunately number three is gonna be not fixable next we're going to take iphone number four and put all these guts into a new back case and then we're gonna put a new screen on an iPhone number four should be working great and looking great after that you you you that was pretty intense that took a long time there's a lot of super minor details in this I still do have to put some adhesive under the battery but I'm gonna plug in a screen and see if this thing turns on I really hope it does cuz that took so long and if there's something I did wrong way underneath it's gonna take a long time to fix so let's test it and see if it'll turn on all right the screen is in battery's plugged in let's see what happens okay good news so far let's see if the screen works ok does touch work yes it does okay Wow so far everything looks good let's see if it charges and here we go please charge yes great news so far this one is looking great now we need to get the new screen on and then we can close it all up and hopefully we'll have a nice working iPhone 10 now from the little bit I know about the iPhone 10 the true tone display will not work unless you program the serial number from the original screen into the new screen so we're gonna try that next I have this programmer let's try it out I've never done anything like this before so let's see if it works so we're going to read it okay I think that means we're good to go now we're going to try and program the new screen and we will right data verified correct okay so we need to transfer these components over to the new screen then we can plug it in and see if that worked so how does it look is there anything I forgot I think it looks pretty good okay the moment of truth let's see if it turns on and if the touch works well sure looks nice good this touch work yes true tone we've got true tone so number four is turning out to be a beautiful phone I do need to put adhesive under the battery and then we can close it up and have a look at the finished product and how about that we have a working I phone 10 it's all set up that is beautiful now the numbers four is done I've got a couple updates on iPhone number two so if you remember number two came in with no power I thought it was the dock connector as when I plug this one in it seemed to be working better unfortunately I found that it's not actually the dock connector there is a problem on the motherboard it seems as it continues to boot loop sometimes it'll actually boot up and I can use the touchscreen for a minute and then others turn all the way off so I think what's probably happening is this motherboard is bent just like the iPhone we looked at with no touch so unfortunately a number two is also not gonna be something we can fix let's move on to the next iPhone I wanted to look at number 10 since it powers on but has no touch I want to try a new screen and see if it's a screen problem or if it's a motherboard problem alright and number 10 is powered up is touch gonna work I sure hope so let's try uh-oh bummer so that means that most likely this motherboard is shot at least for me technically it is fixable but just not something that I am capable of right now with the equipment and tools that I have or the knowledge and skill for that matter Wow ok so you can see definitely what's likely wrong with this you can just see how bent that is it's gonna be bent and twisted so that's the problem with this one almost for sure is just that the motherboard is bent and twisted and some of those connections are just totally broken inside so unfortunately number 10 is not fixable number 9 does power on we're gonna test it with a new screen and see if it works and here we go number 9 is the screen touch gonna work yes okay let's see what happens when we've got it unable to activate bummer this one says an update is required usually that means that it's not gonna be fixable I will plug it into iTunes and see if it'll work but most likely number 9 is not gonna work for us I'll update you guys if I find out something else but for now I'm considering this most likely not fixable so far we've only been able to fix one out of all these 10 iPhones unfortunately that's actually mostly what I expected I'm kind of surprised we could fix one although we do have number one right here that I think will be fixable as well I just need to change the rear case and the screen and I think that one will also be fixed we've still got a couple more to go though let's see if we can fix anymore while number five is charging let's take a look at number six it had no power I did put a another screen on it and I plugged in the battery so it does have power now but unfortunately it is also unable to activate I'll check this one with iTunes and let you guys know if it is fixable but unfortunately this one most likely is not as well number 7 is the last one that we haven't really looked at yet this is the one with the big hole in the back let's get this screen off and see what it looks like now this one actually did turn on for just a second and then it wouldn't do anything else so I'm gonna get the screen off have a look number 5 just powered up so let's check this out and see what happens let's see if touch works no touch now number 5 didn't have any power at all this is a screen that I know does have touch so unfortunately as you already know no touch is bad news so back to number 7 I'm gonna get the screen off take a look inside and see if we can fix it ok and number 7 whatever it was that went through the back shell right there hit right on the battery maybe on the motherboard first thing I'm gonna do is get this battery out of here as it could be damaged and we don't want to mess around at the damaged lithium-ion battery so I'm gonna get that out put the battery in from number eight that wasn't fixable and then see what happens all right look at this look at how much of a dent that is there it actually didn't really damage the battery much it doesn't look like at least from the exterior but this still not a battery I would use but that is just such a big dent right there let's see if it turns on okay we have power okay and it starts up but does a touchscreen work No so unfortunately number seven is also not fixable but we still do have number one I need to replace the back case and the screen let's get that done now and see how it looks when I'm done so number six and number nine the two I was hooking up to iTunes unfortunately are not fixable there's no way to restore them there was no way to update them and just can't do anything with them but the good news with that is I did notice number six has a really nice rear case and it actually has almost everything on the inside seems to be good as well so I'm actually going to take the motherboard from number one put it in number six and see if that'll work I do need to also install a new screen so I'll do that as well and then once the screen is on we'll test it see if it all works and if so we'll call it good now I am going from a white iPhone to a black iPhone but I actually don't really care about that I'm not planning on selling these I'm just gonna use them for cameras here in the studio most likely and I actually like black better anyway so that works fine now this video is quite long so let's just do this the easy way and there we go we got the motherboard in now we need to get the new screen on and see if it works all right new screen hooked up let's see if it turns on and works all right and there we go we've got a pretty decent back case I do need to clean it up a bit it's pretty dirty but other than that's a pretty good back case got a brand new screen I do need to obviously attach it fully and put the screws in but other than that it looks like this is gonna be a working iPhone so there we have it iPhone number one is also working so out of all ten of those broken iPhone tens we have two that are working it's actually better than I thought I was afraid I wouldn't be able to fix any of them so I'm glad at least got to working so I can use them for cameras or whatever I need around the studio if you want to see me try and fix all sorts of other broken stuff I'll put a playlist up on your screen now so you can come hang out with me over there thank you guys so much for

I might swap the dock out with another one just to see if that gets it working. there well I guess we're taking this one apart anyway so let's get the motherboard out and get this whole entire dock ribbon cable out so here we go the motherboard for number eight is loose okay so the dock connector is this one right here okay dark connector is now loose. in that connector is actually faulting I'm gonna let it charge for a little bit and see what we get so for iPhone number two I was able to get it to connect to itunes it's supposedly downloading an update right now so hopefully that one will work for now we're gonna move on to iPhone number three. the digitizer on this screen is broken so I can't check the rest so we'll need to get another screen on this one to be able to check that let's go back to number four and see if it'll continue setting up and if there are any locks or anything on it. thing I'm gonna do is check out those connectors and see if there's any problems there and then we'll go from there alright it didn't verify this is the digitizer connector so that's the part we need to inspect now. iPhone repair but she has a video about this very same problem and shows how to diagnose it so I'm gonna get under the microscope and show you what I found. The problem with iPhone number three is the logic board on this it has three layers. the chip that gives the touch power and the touch connector itself so unfortunately this is one that I'm not going to tackle I don't have the tools the knowledge or the patience to do something like that so unfortunately number three is gonna be not fixable next we're going to take iphone number four and put all these guts into a new back case. far everything looks good let's see if it charges and here we go please charge yes great news so far this one is looking great now we need to get the new screen on and then we can close it all up and hopefully we'll have a nice working iPhone 10. tone we've got true tone so number four is turning out to be a beautiful phone I do need to put adhesive under the battery and then we can close it up and have a look at the finished product and how about that we have a working I phone 10 it's all set up that is beautiful now the numbers four is done. no touch I want to try a new screen and see if it's a screen problem or if it're a motherboard problem alright and number 10 is powered up is touch gonna work I sure hope so let's try uh-oh bummer so that means that most likely this motherboard is shot at least for me technically it is fixable but just not something that I am capable of right now. that means that it's not gonna be fixable I will plug it into iTunes and see if it'll work but most likely number 9 is not gonna work for us I'll update you guys if I find out something else but for now I'm considering this most likely not fixable so far we've only been able to fix one out of all these 10 iPhones unfortunately. haven't really looked at yet this is the one with the big hole in the back let's get this screen off and see what it looks like now this one actually did turn on for just a second and then it wouldn't do anything else so I'm gonna get the screen off have a look number 5 just powered up. much of a dent that is there it actually didn't really damage the battery much it doesn't look like at least from the exterior but this still not a battery I would use but that is just such a big dent right there let's see if it turns on okay we have power okay and it starts up but does a touchscreen work No so unfortunately number seven is also not fixable but we still do have number one. Out of all ten of those broken iPhone tens we have two that are working. I'm not planning on selling these I'm just gonna use them for cameras here in the studio most likely. I actually like black better anyway so that works fine. actually better than I thought I was afraid I wouldn't be able to fix any of them so I'm glad at least got to working so I can use them for cameras or whatever I need around the studio if you want to see me try and fix all sorts of other broken stuff I'll put a playlist up on your screen now so you can come hang out with me over there.",

      "title": "iPhone X Battery Replacement Tutorial - DIY Guide to Swap Your Old iPhone Battery At Home!",
      "transcript": "welcome back to another idor UK video in this video I'm going to show you how to replace the battery on the iPhone x Begin by powering down the device then take a pentalobe screwdriver and remove the two screws from the bottom of the device once they're removed take a razor blade and create a small gap between the chassis of the phone and the edge of the screen then in the small Gap that you just create take a plastic opening pick and create a larger Gap so that you can slide the pick along the edge of the device separating the screen from the frame work your way along the right hand Edge the bottom Edge and then the left hand Edge don't worry about the top Edge because that should just pop out we can see that this battery has been replaced in the past before going any further it's a good idea to put a heavy weighted object behind the screen to stop it from falling over and then add a few drops just underneath the battery to allow that to start soaking in whilst we remove the screen the iPhone x is one of my favorite FES to work on because to open it up you only need to use a triwing screwdriver and you can remove the battery or replace the screen remove the five TR R screws that hold down the shield just here then use tweezers to lift it up now take a plastic spider and disconnect the battery isolating power from the device it's a good idea now to remove the screen as well because that will get in the way or risk becoming damaged whilst we're removing the battery so use the plastic SP to disconnect this cable this cable and finally this cable just here can now pull the screen away from the device just be careful here because this Flex cable is stuck down just gently pull it upwards to release it freeing the screen whilst the alcohol is soaking in under the battery further it's a good idea to clean up the chassis so just take some tweezers and remove all the leftover adhesive that's left behind on the chassis I'll also clean up this frame with some isoc alcohol just add a bead of it along the edge and then take a brush like a toothbrush and carefully scrub away all the leftover adhesive dust and grime that gets stuck in there just be careful whenever you're working on this top Edge because the sensors for the face idea up here so just be very gentle with your brush don't go screw in the life out of it and damaging that sensor that should have allowed the alcohol that we squirted underneath the battery enough time to soak in and soften the adhesive now so I'm going to take some straight tweezers and try and grab hold of this bit of adhesive pull tab just underneath here and then try and carefully remove it without snapping it notice I wiggle it from side to side that always helps remove them so that's the first one removed successfully there's another three to go though so I wouldn't hold your breath that we'll do it without busting one the key here is to grab the whole part of the of the adhesive tab sometimes it can separate into two parts and then that's when they snap what I find it looks like we' got all of it on this one wiggle it about a little bit that one snapped unfortunately that's the longer of the three but we did get a fair bit of it out before before it did snap that one came out quite nicely in one and then the final one this one is the shorter of the three should come out quite easily now I did snap it a little bit but it's still we've still got a bit of a hold on it that's released for this one on the end because we didn't get it out fully and if you'll snap take a plastic Prim tool like this carefully insert it underneath here and just pry up gently that's what we call the pry of shame I am just going to wipe up any of the alcohol what left left behind and reinstallation is just a case of reversing the steps that we've just taken starting off with our new battery this is a TX Pro brand one these come from a company called the screen surgery here in the UK and they're decent batteries I've had no issues with them up to now we've been using them for a few months they come with the adhesive pre-applied so all we need to do is peel back that pink tape it's a really good idea when you're doing this to First Connect up the battery here and that's going to help us line up the new battery so it's not sat too high or too low so connect it first you're not going to do any harm by connecting it and then place it down apply pressure and that means that the battery will connect perfectly into the FPC that it sits into there once the batter is in and you've applied some pressure pressure to make sure that it's secured down disconnect the battery connector and then take a new adhesive seal for the edges install it first into the top Corner line it up along this left hand Edge and then the rest of it should follow suit sitting nicely around those edges run the wide end of the plastic spider down the edges to make sure they secured properly then peel back the first layer of the film and if it's stuck good only that layer will come away with it before reinstalling the screen just make sure that any adhesive is removed from the back of the display this is something I often see missed and it can cause this the screen not to sit properly reconnect the connector for the OLED panel the touch pan panel is a little bit more difficult and I usually use the spudger just to help me sit in because I've got quite fat fingers pop the heavy object behind the screen again and then line up the cable for the ear speaker now we can reconnect the battery connector then place down the protective shield there is three small screws one really long screw and one screw that's slightly shorter than the really long one two small one go two small screws go in the bottom and next one up then right in the middle of the five screws is the longest one then it's a short one again it's really easy for this cable to get snagged underneath this Shield so just make make sure when you're putting this top screw in that the cable's not snagged and the screws nice and tight finally before sealing this one up I'm going to remove this blue protective film from the battery and then the last layer of the protective film that sits on top of the dust and moisture res it seal and carefully peel that back to reinstall the screen make sure that it sits in at the very top first then squeeze in the left hand Edge for this right hand Edge you want to make sure that this cable here doesn't sit between the screen and the chass so just poke it in before closing it up once it's even all the way around that means is ready to turn back on whil it's turning on we can reinstall the two pental up screws at the bottom of the phone wipe off my monkey fingerprints and then double check that the battery health has gone back to 100% that just about wraps up this video thanks for watching and see you next time",

      "title": "$99 Damaged Google Pixel 2 XL Repair",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back from a huge Jefferies video in this video I'm gonna be repairing this Google pixel to excel from 2017 I purchased this phone for 99 dollars off eBay where they completely shuttered front and lightly cracked back luckily the phone appears to still be functioning underneath as I'm able to see the status bar up top the phone cannot be used in its current state given the damaged OLED screen which only displays a solid color which can change color and brightness the longer the display is lit up but before we get started I'd like to thank iFixit for sponsoring this video get parts tools and guides at ifixit.com slash you Jeffries or at the link below coming back to the pixel it's time to remove that damaged front display ideally you'd want to power down your device or wait for it to go flat if the touch isn't working as there's no way to shut down the device with a damaged screen as I didn't have time to wait for my device to go flat I proceeded by heating up the edges of the phone to soften the adhesive afterwards applying a suction cup so I could apply upward pressure to hopefully create a gap between the frame and screen to insert a plastic pick once the pick was inserted I could simply keep reheating and moving the pick around the edge of the display to separate the screen from the frame while Google has used adhesive to attach the display it was much easier to remove compared to some Samsung phones I've recently worked on this process took me around 6 minutes to complete however of course this all depends on how damaged your display is once I've got the screen lifted up it's time to disconnect the cables which are hidden under some plastic brackets which are clipped into place these are quite dangerous as it's quite easy to slip your plastic pick damaging a connector with the old screen removed I'm gonna take the time to clean up the frame before I can fit on the new panel and test out the phone the cleanup process will depend on how much glass was remaining on the frame which usually depends on how cracked the screen was this one was quite damaged so it took a little bit to now now before I attached my display I'm going to take the time to disconnect the battery the reason I've got to do this is as it currently stands this phone is in sleep mode as I didn't have the time to wait for the battery to go flat and there was no method of shutting down the phone I needed to disconnect that battery before reconnecting it and reattaching the new display disconnecting the battery will shut off the phone so when I connect up the new display I have no chance of shorting out the connection while it's powered on with the phone ready to go it's time to crack out my new replacement Google pixel 2 X out LCD and digitizer assembly from my fix it pulling it out I can test fit it onto the phone by simply connecting up the two connections and we can finally see whether this pixel is indeed still functioning correctly pressing and holding the power button the phone successfully booted up to the lock screen luckily the previous owner had given me his passcode so I was able to sign out of his Google account turning off the factory reset protection and then I could actually just erase the phone and do a factory reset after the phone has successfully erased I could set it up as brand new and had myself a Google pixel too while I had the phone set up I did check the front-facing camera to make sure it wasn't damaged when the display was so now that we know the phone works it's time to continue on with the repair and before I stick down the display I'm going to put on this new replacement piece of glass for the back as well as prep the display up with some new earpiece mesh which both parts are of course coming from I fix it with the phone shut down I can remove the display and turn the phone over where we can heat up the back glass section and I'm going to start removing it with some plastic picks so we can replace this cracked piece with a nice new one on a side note I should also mention the frame on this phone does have a few marks where it was dropped I don't feel that this warrants a whole housing replacement as the rest of the frame is in excellent condition so I'll be leaving it as is after I've removed this piece of glass I will come back with a pick and spudger just remove any remaining glass for when we stick down the new panel it will seat correctly in place I'll also need to take off the camera lens and install that on the new piece of glass with that all ready to go all I need to do is simply press it down into place and that was actually quite a simple repair flipping the phone back over I'm going to clean the speaker and microphone grilles with some alcohol before I start prepping up the new display with the pieces of mesh for the lower grille I reused the original mesh but for the earpiece I've got a replacement one just to go on there with some new fresh adhesive now that the screen is prepped I'm going to attach the new adhesive which will hold the display in place now if you're doing a repair like this do not cheap out on the adhesive make sure you get some quality stuff like this one here from iFixit because this is all that's holding that screen onto the phone and if you have some bad adhesive your screen is likely to lift up or fall off I'll take my time in aligning it and making sure it is seated correctly so I see no adhesive when the screen is stuck down before we can attach the display I'll need to remove this plastic protective film off of the back and then we can attach up the display by connecting its two connectors to the motherboard I'll also need to make sure to reattach the plastic brackets which clip into place and stop the connectors from coming disconnected when the display is sealed into place now before I seal up the phone for good I'm going to give it one last test the reason for this is because once it's sealed into place it will be a really big mess and pain to try and get up the display without cracking it and I'd also need to find some new adhesives to stick down so I ran some tests and everything is working as expected so it's finally time to finish off the repair and seal down into place our new OLED screen making sure it's lined up correctly I can press it down firmly into place on all sites now there are some marks on the side which I decided to just go over with a permanent marker I'm not sure whether this will stay on or come off over time but it does look a little bit better if it is dark as it is less noticeable with that done I can remove the plastic film from the top of the Google pixel too and we're done so this is it a fully functional Google pixel to excel while the frame has some cosmetic damage from a drop I didn't replace it as it didn't impact on the devices functionality this pixel runs Android 9 as it hasn't been used since mid 2019 but it can be updated to Android 10 if I'd like if you guys want to check out the parts that I used in this video along with the tools make sure you go and check out the link down in the description and

      "transcript": "hi i'm emma from idoc in this guide we show you how to replace the whole display unit of your google pixel 2 xl you need to replace the screen if the glass is cracked the touch screen no longer responds stays black or shows weird lines the repair is not that hard because you don't have to remove many parts to replace the screen you need about 30 to 60 minutes we recommend the following tools a flat thin opening tool like the iflex several flat plastic picks a plastic spudger a steel spatula esd tweezers and a suction cup you also need a heat gun or a regular hair dryer to release the display glue at our store you'll find the required spare part together with the most important tools and our idoc magnetic pad as one repair kit you can find the links in the info box below you have to glue the display to close it again therefore a suitable adhesive frame is included with our spare part on our website idoc.eu you can find this guide with detailed photos and videos for each step before the repair do a full data backup and make sure your workplace is clean and well lit if you have any questions just leave a comment below and now enjoy this fix before you start switch off the device press and hold the standby button until the power off option appears tap again to confirm and wait until the device shuts down now you can start and remove the screen the screen of the pixel 2 xl is glued around the edges so you have to heat the edges with a heat gun to around 60 degrees celsius repeat this step and heat the display till you're just about able to touch it now attach a suction cup above the usb port and pull on it then slide a very thin flat tool between the display and the frame and run it around the corner to release it especially on the bottom edge you can't insert the tool too far because there are sensitive electronic parts here don't pry only run the tool around the edges to release the glue if you're using a metal tool like the iflex watch out you don't scratch the frame now insert a pick between the frame and display you can use other picks so the glue stays separated then gradually heat the edge and release the glue all around the display is very thin if the display is badly cracked you have to scratch all the glass pieces from the frame if necessary use a flat metal tool to pick out the glass once all the glue is off you can take off the display fold open the display very carefully because there are still two flex cables attached fold open the display very slowly so you don't break these cables remove the cover marked with one stick a flat tool into the opening and pry it off then remove cover number two the same way this one also has a tape strip which you need to remove unplug both connectors with a spudger you can now put the display away test the new display before you install it to make sure you didn't buy a defective part if you discover any defects please immediately contact the seller to return the part if necessary take the new display and place it next to the case plug in the connectors 1 and 2 and switch on the device check the minimum and maximum brightness of the display and check for pixel errors drag any app across the screen in a zigzag pattern if it doesn't jump the touch function is ok if the display has a protective film pull it off and check if you see visible scratches or other defects if everything is okay switch off the device and unplug both connectors now remove all glue residue so you can close the display properly remove the frame sticker take care not to scratch the frame if you're using a metal tool thoroughly clean the edge of the frame with isopropanol or alcohol run a narrow plastic tool with the moist cloth over it through all the grooves to clean them now attach the frame sticker so you can close your device again the hole for the front facing camera shows you how to align the sticker peel off the outer film and attach the sticker the frame sticker is very thin and tears easily so work very slowly and step by step the blue film must be facing up first attach the top edge of the sticker and make sure it's sitting right then attach the opposite side especially the corners then use a plastic tool to press all edges to the frame you should see the blue film coming off already this shows you that the sticker is sitting properly once the sticker is well attached remove the second film if the black sticker isn't sitting right correct the position make sure there's no glue sticking out since it will show when you press on the screen then pull out the entire inner part of the sticker by pulling on the u-shaped tab if the black sticker isn't sitting right correct the position place the screen on something elevated so the edges don't stick too early make sure all the protective films are off then attach the screen connectors put on the two plastic covers and make them snap in don't forget to attach the tape strip for the second cover place the display in the frame and make sure it's sitting right switch on your device and test the display now drag any app across the screen in a zigzag pattern if it doesn't jump everything is ok check the minimum and maximum brightness of the display and check for pixel errors then press on the display all around press longer to make it hold well after the repair you should give the glue some time to harden you can squeeze the device between two books for example but don't exert too much pressure or the screen could crack that was our fix and i hope you enjoyed it you can find tools and spare

If the display is badly cracked you have to scratch all the glass pieces from the frame if necessary use a flat metal tool to pick out the glass. switch on the device check the minimum and maximum brightness of the display and check for pixel errors drag any app across the screen in a zigzag pattern if it doesn't jump the touch function is ok. If the display has a protective film pull it off and check if you see visible scratches or other defects if everything is okay switch off the device and unplug both connectors. sticker and make sure it's sitting right then attach the opposite side especially the corners then use a plastic tool to press all edges to the frame. Drag any app across the screen in a zigzag pattern. if it doesn't jump everything is ok check the minimum and maximum brightness of the display and check for pixel errors then press on the display all around press longer to make it hold well after the repair. You should give the glue some time to harden you can squeeze the device between two books for example but don't exert too much pressure or the screen could crack.",

      "transcript": "if your phone's battery is getting weak and you would like it to last longer this video shows you how to replace it a new battery also helps if your phone keeps crashing or is always getting slower the repair is very difficult because the pixel 2 xl screen is glued on pretty hard the screen is very easy to damage so you should work very carefully you should plan about 60 to 90 minutes we recommend the following tools a phillips screwdriver a flat thin opening tool like the iflex several flat plastic picks a plastic spudger a steel spatula esd tweezers and a suction cup you also need a heat gun or a regular hair dryer to release the display glue we recommend a flexible plastic tool such as the eye plastics to remove the battery find the spare part in the info box below you can find our high quality tools together with our idoc magnetic pad as a repair kit you have to glue the display to close it again below you can find a link to the matching adhesive frame for your device on our website idoc.edu you can find this guide with detailed photos and videos for each step before the repair do a full data backup and make sure your workplace is clean and well lit if you have any questions just leave a comment below and now enjoy this fix before you start switch off the device press and hold the standby button until the power off option appears tap again to confirm and wait until the device shuts down now you can start and remove the screen the screen of the pixel 2 xl is glued around the edges so you have to heat the edges with a heat gun to around 60 degrees celsius repeat this step and heat the display till you're just about able to touch it now attach a suction cup above the usb port and pull on it then slide a very thin flat tool between the display and the frame and run it around a corner to release it especially on the bottom edge you can't insert the tool too far because there are sensitive electronic parts here don't pry only run the tool around the edges to release the glue if you're using a metal tool like the iflex watch out you don't scratch the frame now insert a pick between the frame and display you can use other picks so the glue stays separated then gradually heat the edge and release the glue all around it's better to heat the screen several times if you feel too much resistance instead of bending it once all the glue is off you can take off the display fold open the display very carefully because there are still two flex cables attached fold open the display very slowly so you don't break these cables remove the cover marked with one stick a flat tool into the opening and pry it off then remove cover number two the same way this one also has a tape strip which you need to remove unplug both connectors with a spudger you can now put the display away all the other parts are under a metal mid frame remove the equal length phillips screws fastening this frame and store them so they don't get lost then slide a flat tool into the small recess on the lower edge and pry slowly when the frame comes off you can carefully run the tool around the edge to release the clips one by one once the frame is released all around you can take it out the battery connector is now free and you can unplug it with a plastic tool always disconnect the battery as soon as possible to avoid short circuits now you can remove the glued battery you have to heat the glue and then gradually pry out the battery we recommend that you remove the neighboring parts such as the main board so you don't damage them this makes the repair a few minutes longer but prevents bricking your phone because that's what happens if you damage the main board of course you're free to follow your own procedure if you feel confident now remove the sim tray stick the sim tool into the hole of the sim holder and take it out to remove the motherboard you need to unplug all the contacts unplug the antenna connector with a slight twist of the tweezers careful the socket on the main board can tear off really easily then unplug all the other connectors using the spudger be careful not to damage any small parts on the main board if possible pry from the side of the connector which has no small parts next to it take out the main board now the board is under the frame ledge on the upper end so first release the board a little and then pull it out from under that ledge and put it aside make sure it doesn't get caught on the cables the battery is easiest to remove from the bottom that's why we're taking out the usb flex cable too the speaker is snap fitted into the device stick a pointed plastic tool into the corner of the speaker and pry it out now take out the usb board first unplug the connector of the antenna cable with a twist of the tweezers then heat the usb flex cable to release the adhesive now slide a flat tool under the flex cable and release it gradually again work very carefully since the usb cable tears easily the upper end near the antenna cable plug is glued very strong so slide a plastic tool under the circuit board here and release the glue very carefully also remove the plastic microphone cover next to the usb board with a spatula then release the microphone from the case once the whole usb flex cable is off you can take it out of the device the battery is glued in the middle so you can't just pry it out at the bottom there's some space where you can get the tool under the battery easily first heat the back cover but not the battery directly to release the glue then slide a flat plastic tool such as the eye plastic under the battery you should release the glue instead of prying the battery all the tools we use for this repair are linked in the video info below leave the tool stuck under the battery and heat the rear case several times slide in the tool carefully to separate the glue take extra care not to damage the battery it bends very easily when you pry it especially when hot never heat the battery directly instead heat the opposite side of the device do not use any sharp metal tools to pry it out take a flat broad plastic tool instead when you notice that the battery is hard to remove heat the bottom of the device and try again there are several connectors and other components around the battery make sure not to damage them once all the glue is released you can take out the battery the back film at the edge can tear when you remove the battery this is no problem as long as the silver wrapper of the battery does not get damaged now prepare your new battery before the installation remove all the protective films place the new battery right in the middle of the adhesive surface make sure there's enough space on all sides and don't get any cable stuck underneath now press down the battery to make it stick then stick the usb flex cable back in stick the microphone and the usb port back into their openings then paste the flex cable into the frame all over make sure you don't squeeze in any cables now connect the antenna cable plug grab the cable end with your tweezers and then attach the plug also insert the microphone holder and press it so it snaps into place next insert the speaker unit and press it in to insert the main board first bend all the connectors to the side so that they don't get stuck under the circuit board now put the main board in the device and press it in you have to slide in the main board under the upper edge of the device make sure you don't squeeze in any cables attach the main board's connectors as well as the thin antenna cable the connectors should engage with a slight click do not slip because the contacts are very sensitive before inserting the sim tray if necessary put in the sd and the sim cards then slide in the sim tray if it doesn't go in easily do not press harder first check if the main board is seated properly now connect the battery again then put the mid frame back in and press it to make it snap into place now fasten the frame with the equal length phillips screws now remove all glue residue so you can close the display properly remove the frame sticker take care not to scratch the frame if you're using a metal tool thoroughly clean the edge of the frame with isopropanol or alcohol run a narrow plastic tool with the moist cloth over it through all the grooves to clean them now attach the frame sticker so you can close your device again the hole for the front facing camera shows you how to align the sticker peel off the outer film and attach the sticker the frame sticker is very thin and tears easily so work very slowly and step by step the blue film must be facing up first attach the top edge of the sticker and make sure it's sitting right then attach the opposite side especially the corners then use a plastic tool to press all edges to the frame you should see the blue film coming off already this shows you that the sticker is sitting properly once the sticker is well attached remove the second film if the black sticker isn't sitting right correct the position make sure there's no glue sticking out since it will show when you press on the screen then pull out the entire inner part of the sticker by pulling on the u-shaped tab if the black sticker isn't sitting right correct the position place the screen on something elevated so the edges don't stick too early then attach the screen connectors put on the two plastic covers and make them snap in don't forget to attach the tape strip for the second cover place the display in the frame and make sure it's sitting right then press on the display all around press longer to make it hold well after the repair you should give the glue some time to harden you can squeeze the device between two books for example but don't exert too much pressure or the screen could crack that was our fix and i hope you enjoyed it you can find tools and spare parts on our

      "title": "$99 Damaged Google Pixel 2 XL Repair",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back from a huge Jefferies video in this video I'm gonna be repairing this Google pixel to excel from 2017 I purchased this phone for 99 dollars off eBay where they completely shuttered front and lightly cracked back luckily the phone appears to still be functioning underneath as I'm able to see the status bar up top the phone cannot be used in its current state given the damaged OLED screen which only displays a solid color which can change color and brightness the longer the display is lit up but before we get started I'd like to thank iFixit for sponsoring this video get parts tools and guides at ifixit.com slash you Jeffries or at the link below coming back to the pixel it's time to remove that damaged front display ideally you'd want to power down your device or wait for it to go flat if the touch isn't working as there's no way to shut down the device with a damaged screen as I didn't have time to wait for my device to go flat I proceeded by heating up the edges of the phone to soften the adhesive afterwards applying a suction cup so I could apply upward pressure to hopefully create a gap between the frame and screen to insert a plastic pick once the pick was inserted I could simply keep reheating and moving the pick around the edge of the display to separate the screen from the frame while Google has used adhesive to attach the display it was much easier to remove compared to some Samsung phones I've recently worked on this process took me around 6 minutes to complete however of course this all depends on how damaged your display is once I've got the screen lifted up it's time to disconnect the cables which are hidden under some plastic brackets which are clipped into place these are quite dangerous as it's quite easy to slip your plastic pick damaging a connector with the old screen removed I'm gonna take the time to clean up the frame before I can fit on the new panel and test out the phone the cleanup process will depend on how much glass was remaining on the frame which usually depends on how cracked the screen was this one was quite damaged so it took a little bit to now now before I attached my display I'm going to take the time to disconnect the battery the reason I've got to do this is as it currently stands this phone is in sleep mode as I didn't have the time to wait for the battery to go flat and there was no method of shutting down the phone I needed to disconnect that battery before reconnecting it and reattaching the new display disconnecting the battery will shut off the phone so when I connect up the new display I have no chance of shorting out the connection while it's powered on with the phone ready to go it's time to crack out my new replacement Google pixel 2 X out LCD and digitizer assembly from my fix it pulling it out I can test fit it onto the phone by simply connecting up the two connections and we can finally see whether this pixel is indeed still functioning correctly pressing and holding the power button the phone successfully booted up to the lock screen luckily the previous owner had given me his passcode so I was able to sign out of his Google account turning off the factory reset protection and then I could actually just erase the phone and do a factory reset after the phone has successfully erased I could set it up as brand new and had myself a Google pixel too while I had the phone set up I did check the front-facing camera to make sure it wasn't damaged when the display was so now that we know the phone works it's time to continue on with the repair and before I stick down the display I'm going to put on this new replacement piece of glass for the back as well as prep the display up with some new earpiece mesh which both parts are of course coming from I fix it with the phone shut down I can remove the display and turn the phone over where we can heat up the back glass section and I'm going to start removing it with some plastic picks so we can replace this cracked piece with a nice new one on a side note I should also mention the frame on this phone does have a few marks where it was dropped I don't feel that this warrants a whole housing replacement as the rest of the frame is in excellent condition so I'll be leaving it as is after I've removed this piece of glass I will come back with a pick and spudger just remove any remaining glass for when we stick down the new panel it will seat correctly in place I'll also need to take off the camera lens and install that on the new piece of glass with that all ready to go all I need to do is simply press it down into place and that was actually quite a simple repair flipping the phone back over I'm going to clean the speaker and microphone grilles with some alcohol before I start prepping up the new display with the pieces of mesh for the lower grille I reused the original mesh but for the earpiece I've got a replacement one just to go on there with some new fresh adhesive now that the screen is prepped I'm going to attach the new adhesive which will hold the display in place now if you're doing a repair like this do not cheap out on the adhesive make sure you get some quality stuff like this one here from iFixit because this is all that's holding that screen onto the phone and if you have some bad adhesive your screen is likely to lift up or fall off I'll take my time in aligning it and making sure it is seated correctly so I see no adhesive when the screen is stuck down before we can attach the display I'll need to remove this plastic protective film off of the back and then we can attach up the display by connecting its two connectors to the motherboard I'll also need to make sure to reattach the plastic brackets which clip into place and stop the connectors from coming disconnected when the display is sealed into place now before I seal up the phone for good I'm going to give it one last test the reason for this is because once it's sealed into place it will be a really big mess and pain to try and get up the display without cracking it and I'd also need to find some new adhesives to stick down so I ran some tests and everything is working as expected so it's finally time to finish off the repair and seal down into place our new OLED screen making sure it's lined up correctly I can press it down firmly into place on all sites now there are some marks on the side which I decided to just go over with a permanent marker I'm not sure whether this will stay on or come off over time but it does look a little bit better if it is dark as it is less noticeable with that done I can remove the plastic film from the top of the Google pixel too and we're done so this is it a fully functional Google pixel to excel while the frame has some cosmetic damage from a drop I didn't replace it as it didn't impact on the devices functionality this pixel runs Android 9 as it hasn't been used since mid 2019 but it can be updated to Android 10 if I'd like if you guys want to check out the parts that I used in this video along with the tools make sure you go and check out the link down in the description and

      "transcript": "hi hi i'm marco from idoc in this tutorial we show you how to replace the display of your google pixel 2. the repair is not that difficult because the display can be removed directly without removing other parts please plan about 30 to 60 minutes for the repair we recommend the following tools a torx t5 screwdriver a flat opening tool such as the iflex flat picks a steel spatula or esd tweezers and a plastic spudger the tool for loosening the display should be as wide and flat as possible as for example the iflex or the eye plastics it shouldn't have any sharp edges to avoid scratching other parts you'll need a hot air gun or an ordinary hair dryer to loosen heavily glued parts in order to close the device clean and safe again you have to re-glue the display we supply the appropriate adhesive frame for our spare part we have also summarized all details to this manual in the video description there you will find all links to the spare part in the tools on our website idoc.edu you will find this manual with detailed photos and videos for each step make a backup of your data before the repair and make sure that your workplace is clean and well-lit and now have fun with the repair check your spare part for visible damage before repairing it take a close look at the surface and the flexible cable if something is not in order do not install the spare part but return it to your retailer for replacement switch off the device to avoid short circuits during repair the display of the pixel 2 is heavily glued you can loosen it by heating the glue and sliding a flat tool between display and frame but beware after a repair the pixel 2 is no longer take a hot air gun or an ordinary hairdryer and gradually heat up the entire edge of the display don't heat the phone too much just so much that you can still touch it well tools like the eye plastics or the iflex are ideal for opening the iflex is particularly flexible has rounded edges and is very thin yet stable there's a small gap between the frame and display where you can insert your tool then follow along the entire frame and gradually loosen the glue don't push the tool too far into the device and be careful not to hurt yourself on the sharp edges of the cracked display then reheat the spot where you continue to work and guide the iflex further along the edge to prevent the adhesive from reconnecting you can use several picks and insert them into the already loosened part if the display is heavily splintered you can also stick package tape on it this way it stays whole and you have less glass splinters flying around take enough time to loosen the display and proceed slowly and systematically the display is glued very tightly around the speakers at the top and bottom there you have to go a little deeper with the tool and lever a little once all the glue has been removed carefully lift and fold the display the display connector is still secured with a cover plate loosen the two torx t5 screws and remove the plate now loosen the connector with a plastic tool find a spot where you can easily place the tool and then lift off the connector be especially careful not to damage the connector socket or components on the board now get the replacement display and check if you still have to take over parts of the old display these include the grills above the speaker openings and the white mount of the front camera you have to carefully remove them from the old display and glue them to the spare part but before you can install the new display you have to clean the frame remove the old glue residue and also make sure that there are no more glass splinters inside of the device you can also use isopropanol and a cloth to remove all the glue to attach the display you need a new adhesive frame by the shape of the edge you can see how it is applied loosen the white film at the edge and put the adhesive frame into the device make sure it doesn't overlap anywhere and then press it firmly against the frame take a small tool to push it everywhere firmly then you can loosen the tab and remove the middle part make sure that the black adhesive remains in the device press it tight again if it comes loose in some places now take the new display and place it on the device carefully bend the cable and connect the connector position the connector over its contact and press it tight the plug should snap in with a light click if this doesn't work immediately don't force it down but take it off again and try it again put on the cover plate and fasten it with the two screws now flip the display over but do not press it down yet before you finally close the device you should test it turn on your pixel 2 and test the screen set the brightness to minimum and maximum drag an apt across the entire screen to make sure that the touch function works at all points if everything is fine you can now close the phone press the display on all sides into the frame give the glue a few hours to set properly for example you can lightly weight down the phone with a few books the repair is now finished and i hope you enjoyed it if you have any questions suggestions or hints

      "title": "Google Pixel 2 Battery &amp; Screen Replacement",
      "transcript": "everyone it's Dustin with Tekken beat today we're going to be fixing a Google pixel to not the excel but anyways when we plug it in I've tried multiple chargers cleaning the charge port it just blinks here and then it'll come alive and then just reboots back into doing the same thing here so the church port is perfectly clean not sure what is going on we have a charge port and battery available and so this is gonna be a Google pixel to replace in a charge for testing it battery testing it and also testing and replacing the screen as well okay so we're going to start tearing down this device here so it feels like it's charging but the battery's not targeting so I feel like it's going to be a battery but for it being such a new phone it's unlikely there was a little bit of stickiness but she claims she has not got a wet except for a possibly snow I am actually doing this at 10:35 p.m. at night in Sandy and really so far she finds out tomorrow right oh boy so what we're gonna have to do is get it nicely going to the touch make sure you have your heat-resistant gloves on and I shouldn't say warm to touch hot to the touch today we're all recording on my iPhone XS max with a 2x zoom on it since this sitting a little high we're literally doing this in the Hilton Garden Inn in Sandy in their Lobby I love it so what we're going to try to do is establish it and give her the option to keep the screen like this but if we can't salvage it she'll have to pay for a new one but it being broken so much she's probably best to replace it but I'm still going to be careful to show you guys how to remove this without breaking it further so it's it's getting fairly hot but still not hot to touch and this depends on your level of hot to touch Mitchell is your that's very hot now but if you get it too hot then basically you're not going to be able to replace we use the screen and that's the goal here is to reuse the screen so we're going to take our I flex tool and just slice up and down here we're trying to get this nice and loose they adhesive and then we'll wrap around here and get underneath this we're going to get this nice and loose here as well Tech MD YouTube yeah this video will probably be up in one month but possibly to three weeks yeah that's our company name as that can be YouTube or YouTube yeah so how you spell YouTube yeah because I just wanted to differentiate the two businesses okay so now we're gonna dive in a little bit deeper at this angle here just cut right there and so if if you have the LCD you can see the cables right here so you don't want to go too deep the cable starts down there diving again too deep you know that we got that open still fairly warm that's important now we can twist this up we're twisting this way like I said we're trying to salvage this screen here okay so we have some adhesive we're just gonna cut that off and pull the screen up or down or separate it like this then when a blast it was more heat as we separated and there should be a fully salvaged screen without any problems can't really check because her phone doesn't turn on but at this time you would check and then go about replacing whatever you need in here so we need the this screwdriver here which is a t5 great at the iFixit toolkit or i buy the titanium ones online on the eBay Amazon well there so we're gonna take that out all we do is just pull this cable and lift it up as close as you can in this whole entire bracket usually pops off and this as well you just check your cable make sure you didn't break anything looks like I didn't cut anything so that's good okay so the next story here is we're going to take all these Phillips screws and there is another Torx one up here and more Phillips all around so just only one Forks that I can see so far you want to keep this organized on your map if you have a Matt injured gadgets cells at mentor sells it and sell over several ever old company fell oh my gosh yeah I'm a I usually wake up at 6 in the morning so my bedtime is like in 20 minutes at the most but I'm all jazzed up and excited for this YouTube video so why not I've been looking for my next good to YouTube video you can take a magnetizer here and we magnetized my screwdriver but I've got those screws that don't want to come out so these are just regular Phillips screws take your regular Phillips screwdriver and take those screws out I don't have time to do mess with that plus my hand starts getting tired after fixing 15 phones a day so I use this electric screwdriver it's called a while stick if anyone is curious is awesome and it's like thirty to fifty dollars out there in depending on where you get it I'm training somebody right now I have several people interested why you you're seven general boy you're saying already expanded out to Colorado felt terribly because I ran out of money less and learned so I just use a pentalobe screwdriver but SIM card tool to pop this out that's all you need you're gonna pop out her verizon chip and then we're just gonna separate this frame from this mid frame so all I did was just twist both sides and I already started coming up a little bit here and so you could take your finger plastic tools or even your iFixit tool and twist off let's try plastic tool for safety because I don't know what's under here yet I've never actually opened up the pixel further than this it looks like we've missed a hidden screw right here so we take that out there any more up yep there's another one right here I think that's crude ones up there okay now we can do some more twisting action here yeah that's you scrape up connections so we try not to Oh missed another screw oh my gosh so many screws you see I'm the reason why I'm missing screws guys is because I might getting my head like into this and covering the camera so just please bear with me I don't do that on purpose and just I'm not looking at it very closely like I normally would I would highly recommend getting nice and close and personal with this now as I remember on the Google pixel there's something up top that catches this so let's see if there's anything up top yes there is and that's that crazy connector holy moly how you supposed to get that back on her battery is warm and Phil's bloated so let's give this a go and try another battery real quick here and see if we can get the unit to turn on seems tiny tiny just barely noticeable okay so battery we go this way in that way connect so we could potentially connect it this way guys get in your way okay now we're going to reconnect the screen let me call you okay now that the screens reconnected well your call will be on YouTube so there's your phone turning on we'll see okay so now that we got the phone turned on I'm going to plug in our brand new USBC port so we've already confirmed it was not a court and confirm it wasn't the port okay so the unit will not charge wait it is charging I just didn't hear a Dean what's the password so we got 24% here and we're gonna wait until it goes to 27 okay we're back here and we got a 37% charge was sitting here talking with each other and forgot about the phone so she's decided to do the smart decision and get a new screen but as you can see even broken I was able to take it off without cracking it further and that's when you call yourself a true expert when you can take one of these screens off without breaking them I guess if you're a master technician like some people I've met recently they can pull this screen off off a curve bum now that is quite impossible in my opinion okay anyways we're going to go ahead and pop this battery out and the old broken screen and as you can imagine you know your charge port here is right here and you just have to disassemble this shouldn't be too difficult to take this out and pop this in but you'd have to disconnect this and some of these cables to remove the charge board as of today we are not doing that but this is going to be just a simple battery and screen replacement not too simple but challenging enough okay so this cable is totally in our way of what we want to do but maybe not we'll find out here see if this battery will pop out easily for us just careful not to puncture anything so I'm just very lightly doing this because I don't know what's under here all these cables are right along this batter here very annoying just lifting up and they're gonna pull this out hmm give me a little bit of a jerk okay so this is all the cables that you could damage your pressure squeezers and this of course in these cables here so just be really careful so I came out like this so it's exactly what we're gonna do should be enough yep there's enough stickiness to just stick it back on putting any more additional adhesive I'm going to plug the battery in you plug our charge port cable back in remove that tape so I can actually see what I was doing and I know this is going off-camera but I was trying to angle it just right so I could see this here okay now we can set this panel back on somehow so what I'm thinking about doing here is let's try to remove this piece out here carefully a slice underneath okay so we've sliced underneath here and now we can connect this piece here that doesn't tweezers I can do this on film as I remember it was connected this direction here inside of my fingers are getting the way we're going to connect it and it feels snapped in now if we can weave this thing back in just weave that little cable right there push all this down okay it looks like there's a little clasp right here we're gonna have to angle it this way underneath please this is all getting on the camera here so we have to angle it at an angle like this and push it in underneath and we're clipping it down so now I'm gonna get all these screws back into their original spot should be pretty straightforward and we're just going to fast-forward through this yeah it says coronation tokine yes was it yeah I know very interesting as business model myself I can use it for your classes good it's for small bits thought that was your Ellison yep I only use a propeller and wise reserves are just right things everything else you scan tools that are like made of Germany the good stuff but it works for just monogamy I'm doing 25 Phillips goes goes they want put Canyon you know I was great in math but never good at English okay so we're gonna try this new screen here and make sure it works and then we're gonna scrap the old screen for some components and you'll see here in a second what I'm talking about so we're just checking and making sure everything is functioning and I did it correctly and the screen is good I felt it vibrate maybe loose my only screen so I hope it works that would be pretty lame yeah at the very least because everything's from China that's all his job was was literally negotiating pricing for a little different geek paraphernalia could win the monthly subscription box hmm really that sounds cool so probably have to restart it because I put a new screen on there haven't felt it vibrate yet come on there it is I felt the screen works and everything I put together works so now we're going to try that every screen one more time come on baby blue back on them I think what I did was just I connected right so well connecting these new displays guys it is very challenging to get your finger in there so you get like a really heavy-duty tool like I'm using right here to put some pressure on it and you just wanna make sure you hear that clicking so I'm just going back and forth between the cable and making sure it's connected with some pressure not too much but some pressure so now that we've confirmed its off it just turned back on I see no lights main don't really have a defective screen that's a first effective pixel screen I ran into okay we're going to see if I can find another one okay it's a Christmas miracle I had an extra one this got a bad one apparently who knows a good thing I had a second one I thought I only had one left so she is in luck and so what you do is just go ahead and test the screen and make sure it's fully functioning and then we're going to glue it all down so we need to get some of this stuff off so all I do is just set my heat gun like this up and then I move this over for like 10 seconds but I'm gonna do it off-camera just shake it back and forth like this that's anything I'm just trying to get hot about 10 seconds all I'm doing is just getting this piece off here you know put the piece back on and through ear mesh and there's a piece of glass on it too and just noticed and make sure there's no glass on it what I'm doing just scraping some glass off might get you down break you New Jersey housewife it is great so all I'm doing is just lining it up and eyeing up and pushing with my fingers right here so unfortunately for some reason they're not sitting and sending new ear miche's because I guess they hate us which sucks and I'm just going to get the camera ear speaker off or not camera ear speaker but this plastic piece that goes around the camera plug it in there easy peasy if you replace the screen you can always check this frame to make sure it's not dinged up too much if it is you might have to bend it outward for frame looks perfect and then you can check the back glass make sure that's not correct because you could always do it a good service right then and there for a little bit cheaper than later on especially if you're mobile like us tech indeed so many people ask me about how to join tech Envy things have changed feel free just to email me and I'll explain it you need a month of training and fifteen thousand dollars for parts that's just investing in yourself not through me okay so you want to put down your adhesive and I'm pretty sure this adhesive is no good so we're just going to scrape off the old stuff just use our eye flex it tool and iFixit toolkit I try to leave this ear mesh on loudspeaker mesh whatever we want to call it you know I need to get a little intro on my youtube channel maybe I'll convince somebody to make me one but we are we got to put some tape down around this for this phone and I've always called it with my customers and youtubers alike I tell you guys is arts and crafts times with Destin today I give my one millimeter tape I need to get another roll of Tessa tape just find your beginning and put some tape down it's best to do this with the exacto knife but I my exacto knife broke use your excessive tape just to put in other areas might as well utilize it and not waste it this tape is really whacked on me on the home stretch here doesn't need to be perfect but exacto knife could make it perfect if you really want it perfect because you may be OCD I can get that way many times I just want to get this done and get to bed which that's where I'm at right now then take the two millimeter one you just throw some tape down right here extra love got to put the SIM card in sometimes I'll do that now I'm thinking about it once you screw those screws in you can throw this on card in you're really gonna drive you have a rental car so the the plane flight is you've messed up or what must have been tired or something so they won't let you fix it because you want to go home huh so you want to drive through that nasty storm you know Oh in Utah I want to drive to Grand Junction and take a hop isn't that really expensive to drop your rental car somewhere else business yeah all right so now that we got our pieces on here got that piece in there we are ready to stick this on but before you stick it on one more verification that it totally works this is very critical sometimes when sticking these on you like oh I missed a click you click this all on throw the bracket on probably your screw um put your screw on not throwing on route in t5 and then we can finalize this repair as soon as we got screen we got screening so take off the plastic to help you guide it these phone repairs are still fairly expensive guys so if you're watching this we can always you can always Mel your phone in and we can do this repair prices are subject to change so don't expect it to stay at once MD for this repair but if you wanted to Mel your phone in because you're in ruel wherever looks like my battery said it was dying so I don't know what happened there but I'm not sure what we miss but I'm just gonna review here before I clipped it on I I clipped it on scuze me I screwed it in okay and then I tested it make sure it was turning on and then I stuck it down okay if you missed any of the tape options basically I'm just separating the tape off it and sticking tape test tape all around it not sure what was missed on the video it didn't really tell me it turned off the kinolife own anyways so yeah I recommend using liquid glass cut the iPhone storage is really stupid it keeps on saying that iPhone storage is out even though it's not they do some kind of weird compression technique and I have plenty of gigs so I'm not sure what's going on but basically I need to get the bigger iPhone excess max because it's just not working and of course you no good oh I don't know what's going cause a good old no Samsung won't let you record more than five minutes in 4k so that's out of the question we can't do that at all anyways so you guys watch the Google pixel XL - or a Google pixel - battery placement and screen replacement I appreciate you guys watching please like and subscribe

      "title": "Huawei Mate 10 Pro Teardown - Is true beauty on the Inside?",
      "transcript": "The Huawei Mate 10 Pro, in my opinion, is\nthe best looking Huawei phone yet. This titanium gray color with a reflective\nband highlighting the dual camera units looks pretty sweet. Huawei brought me to CES this year to live\nstream the launch of the Mate 10 Pro over on my Facebook and show the world the outside\nof their phone. Now it's time to show off the insides of the\nMate 10 Pro here on YouTube. Let's get started. The exterior of the phone is rather exquisite,\nbut as we know, true beauty lies on the inside and it's time to open her up. Getting inside the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is pretty\nsimilar to other water resistant glass backed phones. Heat is our best friend, along with a strong\nsuction cup and some pry tools. My metal pry tool does the initial penetration,\nand then the paper business card slips underneath to slice the remaining adhesive while moving\naround the curve of that 3D glass. I'm being careful not to put too much pressure\nor stress on the glass. I don't want to damage anything. As the waterproofing cools down, it'll harden\nback up and grip the glass even tighter, so I'll keep warming it up until the adhesive\nis cut all the way around the outside of the glass. The fingerprint scanner is still attached\nto the back glass panel and still plugged into the phone. There is some super thin foam under that glass\nto keep some separation between the back panel and the battery. Normally at this point I like to unplug the\nbattery, but we still don't have access to that particular plug. So I'll remove this upper protective panel\nthat's 8 screws and set that off to the side. This metal panel has the LED camera flash\nbuilt in which is kind of cool. Now that the covering is removed we have access\nto the battery plug, which I'll unsnap first, followed by the fingerprint scanner ribbon\n– both unsnapping like little Lego's. I'll set that rear glass panel off to the\nside. I might be able to make this clear in a future\nvideo, but those aluminum protective plates would still be blocking most of the internal\ncircuits from view, so we'll have to see what happens. I'll unsnap the large charging port ribbon\nand make my way down to the bottom protective plate with it's 6 screws. It was nice of Huawei to use the standard\nPhilips head screws inside their phone and not go invent some proprietary screws of their\nown. The metal protective plate pops off nicely,\nalong with both the white antenna wires, and the loud speaker Lego-style connector. Once those are all off, the whole charging\nport contraption can be removed from the phone exposing some pretty cool things. We have the circular vibration motor and a\nrubber band around the USB-C charging port. That rubber helps keep liquids from ingressing\nthrough the port into the sensitive electronics. One cool thing that Huawei mentioned during\ntheir live stream was that the Huawei Mate 10 Pro can have 58% of it's 4000 milliamp\nbattery super charge in just 30 minutes, which means that the Mate 10 Pro charges 50% faster\nthan the iPhone X, and that gets a thumbs up from me. There are watertight screens over the microphone\nholes in this phone. And if we pop out the loud speaker, we find\nanother watertight screen over the larger hole. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is IP67 water resistant. Now the battery itself is a massive 4000 milliamp\nhour capacity, blowing the iPhone X and larger Note 8 out of the water. There are no magical pull tabs under the battery\nthough, and this is one of the hardest batteries I've had to remove in a long time, which is\nkind of unfortunate since the battery does need to be removed in order to replace a cracked\nscreen which I'll explain in a second. Bending or puncturing that battery would be\npretty dangerous. Magical pull tabs would have made a good addition\nto the construction. This long display ribbon cable is for the\nscreen, so I'm taking special care not to damage this during the battery removal. The next cool thing to look at are the large\naperture dual f/1.6 cameras. To get access to these, the motherboard needs\nto come out of the aluminum frame. I'll unclip those extra wire cables. I'll unsnap the front facing camera and then\nlift the whole motherboard from the phone. The frame is pretty cool and you can still\nsee the mill markings from the machine that carved this frame from a single block of aluminum. If Huawei is watching this, I want to come\nfilm that aluminum carving machine as soon as possible. The motherboard has that SIM card tray housing\nand two splotches of thermal paste to help transfer the heat from the chip set to the\nframe of the phone. Aluminum, while not quite as good as copper,\nstill ranks pretty high with thermal conductivity when compared with other metals. A lot of computer heat sinks are made from\naluminum. And Huawei is multitasking the aluminum frame\nof their phone to cool their processors. The dual cameras are built into one housing. The bottom lens is a 12 megapixel optically\nstabilized color lens, while the top is a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor. Both have an f/1.6 aperture. Now for a screen replacement like we've seen\non other phones, this screen is glued into the frame and will most likely not survive\nif I try to remove it. A new screen would just feed the new cable\nthrough the frame and sit right back in the old spot. Pretty straightforward. Hopefully it all works when I put it back\ntogether. We'll find out quick enough. I'll tuck the motherboard back into the aluminum\nframe, and clip the front facing camera down along with the volume ribbon, center screen\nribbon cable, and the two white wire cables off to the side. Then I'll jump down to the bottom loud speaker,\ncharging port, and take special care to feed that loud speaker connection in between the\ncharging port ribbon legs so it plugs in nicely. The two little white wire cables get plugged\nin, and the metal protective plate gets screwed in over top with the 6 Phillips head screws\nfor that bottom panel. Before the top metal plate can go on, I'll\nconnect the charging port ribbon and the fingerprint scanning ribbon. The last thing I want to plug in is the battery. The metal plate can go down over top with\nit's 8 Phillips head screws, and the back glass panel will probably need new double\nsided tape to hold it in place. Replacement backs usually come with this preinstalled. I'll try and leave some links down in the\nvideo description. I'm pretty excited for this phone. It seems like it has a solid build, a good\nprice, and pretty impressive specs. It'll be interesting to see how this handles\nthe durability test when I get my hands on a retail box. And huge thanks to Huawei for letting me show\nthat the inside of their phone looks just as good as the outside. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

      "title": "How to Replace the Battery on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro",
      "transcript": "hello there everyone and this video I want to show you how to replace the battery on your Huawei may 10 pro hello everyone welcome to cellular pros in this channel we do tech reviews and tutorials so if you're new to the channel I welcome you to subscribe alright let's go right to the video now so let's get right into it maybe your phone the battery is draining very fast or it's just shutting off out of nowhere so first thing we want to do is power the phone off completely once your phone is powered off we're going to want to remove your SIM card as well so eject the SIM card tray next we're gonna need to give it heat here on the back cover either with a heat gun like this or a hairdryer move it around the edges don't keep it in the same place because it could burn the insides of the phone you can also place it on a hot plate which is what I prefer to use like I'm going to show you here I set it to about 110 degrees Celsius and leave it on there for about 2 minutes we're going to go ahead and get a suction cup we're gonna also use a small Phillips head screwdriver a prying tool and a plastic prying tool another plastic pry tool here or you can also use a business card in case you don't have a prying tool you can fold it in half to make it more solid so next up once it's hot enough get the suction cup you may want to use some gloves I don't have any gloves at the moment so I'm gonna be using this to kind of hold the phone in place so I don't burn myself and we're gonna place the suction cup towards the bottom of the phone towards the charger ports and here we're gonna give it some upward pressure here until we see a slight opening once you see the opening go ahead and place the prying tool inside remember it's best to use a plastic prying tool so that you don't damage anything inside the phone so there we go the prank tool is in there once it's in there you can move it around slightly from side to side to remove the adhesive holding the back cover in place once the prank tools in there completely you can go ahead and remove the suction cup I'm gonna go ahead and use another plastic pry tool here as well to pry on the other side if the back-cover cools down you may want to give it some more heat to soften the adhesive some more so continue to go down all the way you're gonna give it a little bit more pressure here down towards the bottom there we go once you have the both sides completely removed you can go ahead and wiggle it around a little bit to release the rest of the adhesive there we go just a little bit there left and it's off so as you can see here we have the flex cable we're gonna go ahead and remove a small Philips head screw that's holding it down so once you remove that it's going to have a small bracket there which we're gonna pry up with the prying tool there we go and then now we're gonna go ahead and disconnect the flex cable with the plastic prying tool and it is off completely so there we go there we have the back cover off completely next up we're gonna need to remove this back frame here we're gonna be removing a couple of small Phillips head screws to remove this back housing here at towards the top which is going to be covering some flex cables that we need to disconnect there we go so with that out of the way now we can disconnect this flex cable here which is one for the battery one connects with the charger port towards the bottom and then we're going to need to remove all these small Phillips head screws holding down the bottom charging port there we go so with them all out of the way we're going to go ahead and lift up on this bracket holding down the charging port there you go get that out of the way and now we're going to disconnect the Flex cables down here we're gonna have another small flex cable right here and we're gonna have this antenna which we're going to disconnect and then we're going to disconnect the black antenna as well and then the charging port comes out completely all you got to do is just pull up on it a little bit wiggle it and it will come right out there we go with that out of the way now we can go ahead and give the phone here some more heat we can give it some heat here on the screen with a hairdryer heat gun or place it once again on the hot plate for about two minutes once it's hot enough we can go ahead with the prying tool and pry up on the battery gently pry up on it on the sides and it will come out completely once the adhesive is removed so there we go guys that's how you take apart and remove the battery on your Huawei may 10 pro now to put everything back together all we got to do is just connect everything back in reverse order and then once the fingerprint scanner cable is connected position the back cover on correctly and give it some pressure on all sides to make sure it seals correctly all right everyone so that is pretty much it that is how you replace the battery on your Huawei may 10 Pro alright everyone so that's it for this video hope you enjoyed the video and I hope it helped you out if it did please give it a like it really helps to channel a lot so I took for now I'll see you around in the next video and as always peace ciao",

      "title": "huawei mate 10 pro display replacement",
      "transcript": "g'day in today's video i'm doing a oled display replacement on a huawei mate 10 pro this one has been sitting on the heat pad now for two to three minutes at 75 degrees celsius now i'm going to use some isopropyl thin metal pry tool to get into the back of the phone so from here i should just be able to work my way into the groove between the back cover and the back metal cover of the pho or the back frame do be careful the home button does have a flex cable that runs around this section of the phone should be able to slide down just reapply some isopropyl the isopropyl tends to help soften the adhesive or the temperature the heat pad softens the adhesive but the isopropyl tends to eat through the adhesive so that combination usually gets the back cover off reasonably quick as you can see it's already nearly off completely and there we go fold this up hold that over take that off there we go so from here i'll use a small phillips head screwdriver and take out all the phillips head screws that are here to get this shield off then my next goal from there will be to remove the battery and from there i should be able to do a quick and easy way of replacing the actual the display itself one up off and out of the way okay from there that should hopefully be able to be lifted up without losing too many of the screws i'm going to try to leave the table so if i look at the screws in my plastic container they all look to be of the same length so there shouldn't be really any concern of mixing them up okay now for that out of the way i want to disconnect the battery disconnect the flexus the daughter board flex cable fold that out of the way and now from here it's a matter of trying to figure out how to get this battery out of here what i think i'm going to do is spray some isopropyl down this gap here and then pry it out sadly unlike other cheaper models of huawei phones this one doesn't have a little pull tab to be able to get it out which is slightly disappointing here i'm going to use a metal pry tool which is normally not recommended and i find with the combination of the isopropyl it should soften enough that i don't really do any bad damage to the battery itself so i was prying that with a large amount of force probably end up bending the battery and killing it from there and potentially exploding it would rather not run that risk so i tend to go off a bit too much isopropyl than too little should give me enough to start putting one of these under there so looking in there we do have like a weird weird gasket kind of thing i believe that might may be for the double-sided or maybe double-sided adhesive isopropyl bingo we are now in so let's take that battery off to the side and straighten it back up now we should be nearing the home stretch from here we'll be disconnecting this once more and now we're prepped for the next stage now from here since we don't have a concern about a home button or anything like that i'm going to be using a small flathead screwdriver to try and pry it out from there so fury certainly no next option let's go through the gap similar to the back cover and then and we are one screen removed it did delaminate the paint that section clean also all right so so yeah so now i'm reasonably happy with that another thing as well is if you have access to an old toothbrush and you've got glass fragments all over the frame definitely give it a quick scrape over with that toothbrush or quick brush now i'm going to have to swap over the earpiece mesh as that is not on the new piece at least for mine maybe on yours not online so now i'm happy with that i'm going to turn the temperature off i'm going to stick the back cover back on here to heat up heat it up and time to prep the new display from here there's really not much to do to prep it just need to double check which way that needs to go there we go whoops that way that way just so you guys can see now this one use some b 7 000 frame adhesive if it wasn't for the metallic color i'd probably go the beef there oh it was all black i would go this since it's got color i'll go that as it's clear it's a matter of going around the outside of this uh there we go then from here i need to feed the flex cable of the brand new display through the bottom of the phone or while trying not make sure making sure that this part here doesn't fall out do need to take this off as well go comparison at the back do look reasonably similar that's for the front i can ignore that now let's feed this through that's a matter of lining it up massaging it into place just carefully that did sound a bit crusty which is not a good sign okay let's sit in the flush that's sitting flush i'm going to proceed ahead with this click it on then feed the flex cable down from there battery back in temporarily connect it but then disconnect it while you put the rest of it together connect up the door cable now reconnect the battery disconnect the battery again reconnect the fingerprint or the fingerprint scanner reader whatever you want to call it connect it back up connect the battery back up and then right to put the cover back on so with this section here shouldn't have too much concern mainly because all those screws should be the same length you do have to feed it in from the top first and fold it down so now the king of eye would have noticed i've put one screw in one spot that doesn't need to be there yet that doesn't matter that can be changed in just a moment just bonus points for you if you haven't spotted it yet you'll soon see the one that i am talking about here put the battery shield back on sorry for the obstruction there we go there we go fold that over make sure it's going down and back up down and back up again and fold it over from there line it up as where it should be you may have to replace the gasket on there as you can see online i've got it folded over actually i'm sticking out a little bit just here that'll sort out in just a second it needs to go under there apart from that you should be mostly done i hope this helps you for the assembly of your huawei mate 10 pro see ya turns out that crunchy noise was a nothing to be concerned off",

If you have access to an old toothbrush and you've got glass fragments all over the frame definitely give it a quick scrape over with that toothbrush or quick brush now i'm going to have to swap over the earpiece mesh as that is not on the new piece. color i'll go that as it's clear it's a matter of going around the outside of this uh there we go then from here i need to feed the flex cable of the brand new display through the bottom of the phone or while trying not make sure making sure that this part here doesn't fall out. right to put the cover back on so with this section here shouldn't have too much concern mainly because all those screws should be the same length you do have to feed it in from the top first and fold it down. out that crunchy noise was a nothing to be concerned off.",

      "title": "iPhone 8 Teardown! - Screen and Battery Replacement Video",
      "transcript": "Well, I tried to make a clear back iPhone\n8 like I've done with some of my Android phones, but unfortunately I failed. And I'll explain why as we tear this phone\ndown. This video will show how to replace the screen\nand the battery on the iPhone 8. I'll have all the replacement parts and tools\nlinked in the description, like always. Let's get started. The screen removal for this phone is very\nsimilar to the iPhone 7 with two proprietary pentalobe screws at the bottom of the phone. Once those are out I'll grab my suction cup\nand lift up on the edge of the screen to release some of the tension on the frame. Then I slip my thin metal pry tool between\nthe plastic edge of the screen and the metal frame of the phone. Now the iPhone 8 is IP67 water-resistant. Just one step behind the LG V30 and the Galaxy\nS8. But that means there's some adhesive holding\nthe screen down to the frame, so I found it easier to slip in just the tip of my tool\nand slice through that adhesive. It's excruciatingly important to not touch\nany of the fragile ribbon cables along the right side of the phone; they damage extremely\neasily. Also, your phone will not be water-resistant\nafter this repair, but it's also not water-resistant with a cracked screen. Before the screen comes completely away, there's\na series of clasps at the top of the screen. So I'll wiggle the display down just a smidgen\nto clear those and then I'll fold it open like a book. Now that the screen is lifted away, we want\nto disconnect the battery. We'll find that connector under this metal\nplate with the four normal Philips head screws holding it down. Using my plastic pry tool, to not short anything\nout, I'll unclip the battery connector like a little Lego and then pop off the screen\nand home button ribbons; they unsnap like Legos as well. There's one more ribbon at the top of the\nphone for the front camera and sensor array. I'll unscrew these three Phillips head screws,\nmaking sure to keep them organized. All the screws are different sizes so it's\nimportant that they go back I the same hole they came from. And then the top ribbon cable can disconnect\nlike the others. Then the whole screen can pull away from the\nphone. There's quite a bit of black water-proofing\nadhesive around the whole edge of the screen. Now that the screen is out of our way, let's\ntake a look at this battery. It looks a bit different than usual. Instead of two magical pull tabs, we have\n4, which is a good thing in my opinion. If you fail on one, it's not that big of a\ndeal. Basically, with the magic pull tabs, you grab\nthe lip of the little black tab and then pull it out from underneath the battery. As the adhesive stretches it loses its stickiness. Just repeat the process three more times with\neach of the little pull tabs. These are seriously the best way to adhere\na battery. No heat or violence required for removal. The four tab method also keeps the adhesive\nfrom sticking to the top of the wireless charging which you'll see here in a second. Now that the battery is out, you can see why\na glass backed phone was impossible. The entire back is actually metal, except\nfor the wireless charging pad in the center. So there would be nothing to look at anyway,\neven if the glass could become clear. This metal frame is also probably what kept\nthe phone so rigid during my durability test. The adhesive that holds the rear glass panel\nagainst this metal does not soften with heat like the Samsung phones do. It's a pretty permanent situation. I'll dive deeper into the wireless charging\nand waterproofing of the iPhone 8 in another video. This is just the battery and screen replacement. I'll add some adhesive to keep the battery\nfrom rattling around inside the phone. And if a battery replacement is all you needed\nto do, just reattach the screen and you're good to go. But if you have a cracked or damaged screen,\nor you're bored and just want to watch the rest of this video, the iPhone 8 screen replacement\nportion starts now. Up at the top lies the earpiece which is also\none of the dual stereo speakers. This needs to be transferred over to the new\ndisplay. There's a metal bracket with 3 Philips head\nscrews holding it down. Remember to keep all those screws organized\nin a way that they can go back in the holes they came from. Pulling that front 7 megapixel camera out\nof the way reveals two more Philips head screws that hold down the speaker. After the speaker's out, there's nothing left\nbut some adhesive holding down that upper sensor array. It's important not to put too much pressure\non the ribbons as you lift them up; these are about as fragile as paper and can tear. So if you want to keep things functional,\ngo slow and be careful. Now the only thing between us and a new screen\nis a large metal plate covering the back of the LCD that we will most likely have to transfer\nover to the replacement display. This has Apple's usually proprietary white\ntriple zero screws, also sometimes called the Y.6 tri-wing. It's funny that no matter how hard Apple tries\nto keep people from repairing their phones, the same people develop new tools to get around\nthese barriers. Speaking of barriers, remember that part where\nI said to keep your screws organized? That's especially important with the home\nbutton; this thing is finicky. There are three screws holding the bracket\nin place and one screw going down directly into the button itself. All of these are the same tri-wing screws\nwe've been working with. After that bracket comes off, I'll pull up\nthe fragile as paper ribbon cable from the frame of the screen, and then drop the home\nbutton out through the front glass. The large metal back plate can lift up from\nthe screen at this point, except for the part that is adhered to the paper thin ribbon cables\nat the bottom. Taking special care not to tear the ribbon\ncables, I'll pry them off the metal plate with a plastic pry tool. And this is probably what your replacement\nscreen is going to look like. Just make sure your new screen has everything\nthat your old screen used to have on it. Now at this point, you're either exhausted\nand stressed out from opening up your expensive phone, or maybe asleep from listening to me\ntalk, as long as you've kept your screws organized and haven't sneezed them off the table yet,\nthe assembly process is pretty simple. Tuck the screen and home button ribbon cables\nback up underneath that metal plate and screw it down with the three screws on the left\nside and three screws on the right side. After that, grab the finicky home button and\npush it through the front side of the screen, aligning the ribbon up with the screw holes\nand the pin on the frame. The metal plate goes on top of the home button\nand the three screws around the edge are fine. But it's important not to torque down the\ncenter home button screw too far. Don't even make it tight. It needs to be snug and firm of course, but\nscrew it in too tight and the home button might not work anymore, so be careful. Once the home button's in place, we go up\nto the top for the accordion-like sensor array ribbon. I'll start with the right more box sensor. Plop it into the square hole and then fold\nthe whole thing over to the left, lining everything back up with the grooves they came from. The golden circular pads at the bottom that\ngive signal to the speaker line up with the two pins to keep them in the correct location. The top speaker gets put down before the camera\nand screwed in with the bottom two screws. Then the camera itself gets folded over the\ntop of the speaker and set down into the circular hole it came from. Then the middle bracket with its three screws\nholds everything down tight. It should fit naturally at this point. They won't need to be forced into place if\nyou origami'd everything into the correct position. Now that the screen is assembled, it's probably\neasiest to plug in the top ribbon into the motherboard first since it's at a weird angle. And then the bottom LCD and home button ribbons\nclip in after that – just like little Legos. The battery is the last thing you want to\nplug in. I usually test the phone at this point to\nmake sure the new screen functions. If there are lines going through your screen,\nor it doesn't turn on or look right, it might be a bad connection with the motherboard or\nit could just be a bad replacement screen. Double check the connection first. If that still doesn't work, maybe you screwed\nsomething up during the repair. Things can always go wrong with a phone as\ncomplex as this. The metal brackets that cover the connections\nkeep everything down tight. Just in case you ever drop your phone, nothing\nwill come loose. Three screws on the top metal bracket and\nfour screws on the bottom metal bracket; all different sizes. So make sure the screws get back in the right\nhole. After all the screws are back into place,\nthe phone folds shut like a book and the top of the screen lines up with the metal frame\nfirst. And then the sides clamp in all the way down\nto the base of the phone which clamps in last and has the bottom two screws. And everything works. I'm kind of surprised myself. I'm going to do a complete wireless charging\ntear down and water-proofing analysis in my next video, so subscribe for that and come\nhang out with me on Twitter. I'll have replacement parts and tools linked\nin the video description of this video if you're going to attempt this yourself. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

      "title": "$300 iPhone 8 Restoration - Full of dirt!",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to my Hugh Jeffries video and in this video I'm gonna be restoring this iPhone 8 I purchased this iPhone for $300 and it was the cheapest iPhone 8 on eBay Australia the device was sold as having a badly cracked back and front along with issues with the phone randomly shutting down I will be restoring this iPhone back to brand-new condition as well as changing the colour while I'm at it to product red as I prefer this colour over the original Space Gray this device was advertised as only a 64 gigabyte iPhone 8 there was no photos of the device powered on unlisting so I had no idea on what iOS version this phone was running really strange was the phone wasn't actually wrapped in the bubble wrap rather the bubble wrap was just wrapping a envelope which contained the phone either way though now that I could get the phone out I could take a look at it I did power it up and it didn't display the Apple logo and continued to boot to the hello screen I then attempted to set up the device and obviously I was expecting this to be iCloud unlocked upon setting it up it go to the activation screen where it shut down so connecting the charger it powered back up and I was able to go through the setup and set up the device as brand new there's no iCloud or anything attached to this which is great and going into Settings General and about I could confirm that this is a 256 gigabyte model not a 64 gig model as advertised so I've got four times the storage and the battery health is at 94 percent rating with some experiencing of the unexpected shutdowns to fix this I'm gonna be needing a new replacement housing a new replacement display and a new battery to fix those shutdown issues I'm gonna be starting by disassembling the old device so I can transfer all of those parts into the new housing opening up the display for the first time the phone was filled with rubbish and at this point is obvious that the phone has undergone a screen replacement and that third party that has done this screen replacement hasn't reinstalled the water and dust proofing seal and as a result dust has been able to enter the phone under the display I did notice the display was slightly lifted when I first looked at the device hence whether dust had gotten in I'll need to remove everything from this device as the back is cracked the iPhone 8 makes this an extremely involved and difficult process I'll also need to clean many components that will be going into the new housing to remove as much of the dirt as possible obviously because it's an electronic device I can't just wash it under the tap meaning I'm not going to be able to get it 100% spotless but it will be a lot better than it currently is taking a look at the taptic engine you can see all of the connections coming off of it it's got two on the bottom and another one on the top this thing connects to so many parts of the phone I don't even know why but it really just makes things more complicated to remove one thing that is less complicated to remove is the battery it contains four adhesive strips that are much shorter than previous generations so if you break two of them then you can still get a fair good pry up on that battery and remove it no worries it's easy to remove the lower ones once you get that taptic engine out but I want to remove the logic board before I attempt to get the other two removing the logic board itself isn't actually too difficult there is a lot of screws but after you get a lot of the bigger components off like the dock connector and the Wi-Fi antenna and many of the brackets it's actually not too difficult even under components it's still very dirty and dusty I have no idea where this phone has been it's probably been owned by someone in the construction industry given the amount of dirt and dust inside it I'll need to also remove the camera because that'll be later transferred into the new housing the camera itself is still functioning it did have some dust under the lens obviously because this phone is full of dust but after a clean it will be just fine with the logic board removed we can take a closer look at it and make sure there's no corrosion or any signs of water damage with that all checked out the water indicators are all perfect and there's no damage to the device I can remove the remaining two burner adhesive strips to remove the battery from the phone now actually this one up here is kind of a poor design as it's right above one of the flex cables so it's a little hard to get it out and not accidentally grip on to the flex cable and rip that the battery seems very dented up and I'm guessing that's just from dirt pressing against it and scraping along it inside the phone anyway moving on we can remove the dock connector from the device which isn't held down by too many screws there's also some hidden ones which sort of just face the bottom of the device which you need to make sure to get out as well and then the whole thing just peels up as it's only stuck down with adhesive one thing I don't like about the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 is this location of the dock connector flex cable it actually rests underneath the logic board which makes the whole process of changing your dock connector a lot more difficult than previous generations anyway with the dock removed I can take out the wireless charging module which is held down with adhesive so you want to be careful not to damage that and then there's just a few little small brackets and things up the top of the device which will need to be removed so they can be later transferred across underneath that is actually the LED flash and microphone for the camera that's attached to the volume and power button flex cables which will need to be carefully removed and being very careful not to rip those cables as I didn't have any replacement parts for this with that flex cable removed I can now move along to the little clips along the side of the housing which help hold in the display some of those are actually covered up with a little plastic pieces so I'll need to take those off before I can get access to those screws lastly I'll need to remove the button spaces on the seven and eight you need to pry those from the right hand side and once they lift up disconnect them from the device that's actually relatively difficult to do and it took me a good 10 to 15 minutes now that we have the device fully disassembled we can see everything laid out in front of me this is how I've organized my passes is actually sitting on the magnetic project map from iFixit so shout out for them just sending me one of those as well as an I fix it pro tect toolkit which is what I'm using to repair this iPhone I will leave links to those down in the description in case you want to check those out if you want to do any sorts of repairs yourself now also I just want to mention the housing was purchased via eBay for around $60 it isn't of the highest quality the glass seems really good the aluminum seems really good but those threads are annoying I seem to have a few issues with a couple of the screw holes I wasn't able to get those in but like I said that housing came straight from ebay so unfortunately I just had to live with that that's the problem with the iPhone 8 housings is they're actually relatively expensive compared to previous generations the problem is with the 8 is you can't just replace the back glass well technically you can but the amount of effort it requires and heat or extreme cold and the glass is basically impossible to remove and given my housing was in rough shape anyway I just opted for a complete replacement and I guess the real big difference between say an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 8 is if you drop the seven you're going to put a couple of marks on the back but with the eight you risk completely shattering the back so a small drop could result in an entirely shattered phone instead of just a little dent or a little chip in the corner so durability wise these are nowhere near as durable as previous generation aluminum housings you also want to make sure to transfer over this little black bar thing that actually interacts with the SIM tray if you don't put that in you won't be able to eject SIM cards I'll need to transfer a lot of the smaller components like the dock connector surround into the device and my housing actually came with the new one of those in silver so that was really cool I didn't have to use the Space Gray one from the old iPhone housing I have to say this process was actually kind of difficult there's so much you need to take out and the iPhone 8 to me feels really badly engineered on the inside there's just like way too many connections going to the taptic engine like I don't understand why you need so many previous generations used one cable or one set of pins but with the eight there's like three different connectors coming off of it very strange and I have no idea why that is I don't know whether those help transfer data to something else but it is really annoying and if you don't know what you're doing you can easily damage that taptic engine and it's really evident that Apple is trying to stop you from repairing your own device for instance most of the screws are Phillips but there's these random ones like the one on the top right most side to the taptic engine that random screw right there is a trying bed there's no need for that to be a trying bit yet Apple does that so it makes the replacement off the taptic engine more difficult because it requires another screw driver and this can really deter people from repairing their own device because they might not have the correct bits to actually properly work on the device this may result in them getting stuck halfway through a repair and giving up or just not even attempting the repair in the first place there's also a hidden screw underneath the camera connection the logic boards actually under some foam so if you're doing one of these yourself be sure to remove that screw because if you don't you can actually completely snap it off up the top there of a logic board and that would completely fry the phone now that I've installed the logic board and dock connector I can install the smaller components like the Wi-Fi antenna and the brackets that go over the connection to the volume and power button flex cable with that done it's time to move on to the LCD which is cracked so I'll need to swap that over while doing that I'll also need to swap over the home button but be very careful because this is a device specific button meaning if you damage it and you replace it you'll never have home button or touch ID function as each individual home button is paired to each individual iPhone a lot of people don't understand that they accidentally break it and then never have home button functionality again the only way to fix that is to go to Apple and have them do the screen replacement as they have the correct software they can actually pair data that's stored up on their servers to the phone and make everything work again I'll also need to transfer across the front-facing camera and the earpiece as well as the backing metal plate which seems oddly flimsy compared to previous generations and Apple trying to deter us from repairing our own phones we've got try wing screws throughout the display assembly taking a closer look at the earpiece you can see amount of mental shavings that seem to be attached to the earpiece so I'll need to give that a clean - when the iPhone 8 was released and in early versions of iOS 11 if you put a third-party display on to the iPhone aka a display that isn't paired to the device itself your iPhone would not boot Apple got sued for this of course and now they've removed that with a software update so we can actually change our displays it's amazing - the amount of lengths that Apple goes to try and stop you from repairing your own device I should also mention this is a refurbished panel meaning it is an Apple display it's just had the glass replaced as it was previously cracked with all of the components transferred across from the old display to the new display I can install that waterproofing gasket which was missing from when the phone was last assembled and I can attach the display and earpiece to the device reinstall the appropriate brackets and I'm also in going to install an iPhone 5 battery adhesive strip which makes the battery removal process a lot easier plus I didn't have an iPhone 8 one laying around so I had to opt for this option either way though it's going to do the same job as the official Apple one singing up the device reinstalling the two pentalobe screws and installing a tempered glass screen protector on not only the front but also the back of the iPhone and we're done so this is it a fully restored 256 gig iPhone 8 for a total cost of 319 dollars to put that into perspective at the time of making this video Apple is still selling this iPhone for 1229 Australian dollars that's a saving of 839 dollars just by buying and repairing this iPhone inspecting this iPhone from the outside the housing is a really good aftermarket option it's not a hundred percent perfect but I'm gonna say it's around 98% and it looks absolutely spelling comparing this to the iPhone 7 you can see the difference between the aluminum and the glass let me know down the comments what do you prefer the red and whites or the red and black displays and on that note this has been a huge aries video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and get a sitter checking out the phone restoration playlists for more videos just like this one also make sure to follow me on my social media for behind the scenes and the occasional giveaway that's all for this video and I'll catch you guys next

      "summary": "Hugh Jeffries will be restoring this iPhone 8. The device was sold as having a badly cracked back and front along with issues with the phone randomly shutting down. Hugh will be changing the colour to product red as he prefers this colour over the original Space Gray. obviously I was expecting this to be iCloud unlocked upon setting it up it go to the activation screen where it shut down so connecting the charger it powered back up and I was able to go through the setup and set up the device as brand new. There's no iCloud or anything attached to this which is great. hasn't reinstalled the water and dust proofing seal and as a result dust has been able to enter the phone under the display. I'll need to remove everything from this device as the back is cracked the iPhone 8 makes this an extremely involved and difficult process. contains four adhesive strips that are much shorter than previous generations so if you break two of them then you can still get a fair good pry up on that battery and remove it no worries. After you get a lot of the bigger components off like the dock connector and the Wi-Fi antenna and many of the brackets it's actually not too difficult even under components it's still very dirty and dusty. be just fine with the logic board removed we can take a closer look at it and make sure there's no corrosion or any signs of water damage. The battery seems very dented up and I'm guessing that's just from dirt pressing against it and scraping along it inside the phone anyway moving on we can remove the dock connector from the device which isn't held down by too many screws there's also some hidden ones which sort of just face the bottom of the device. With the dock removed I can take out the wireless charging module which is held down with adhesive so you want to be careful not to damage that. There's just a few little small brackets and things up the top of the device which will need to be removed so they can be later transferred across underneath that is actually the LED flash and microphone for the camera that's attached to the volume and power button flex cables. access to those screws lastly I'll need to remove the button spaces on the seven and eight you need to pry those from the right hand side. Once they lift up disconnect them from the device that's actually relatively difficult to do and it took me a good 10 to 15 minutes. those in but like I said that housing came straight from ebay so unfortunately I just had to live with that that's the problem with the iPhone 8 housings is they're actually relatively expensive compared to previous generations. durability wise these are nowhere near as durable as previous generation aluminum housings. actually interacts with the SIM tray if you don't put that in you won't be able to eject SIM cards I'll need to transfer a lot of the smaller components like the dock connector surround into the device. The iPhone 8 to me feels really badly engineered on the inside there's just like way too many connections going to the taptic engine. trying to stop you from repairing your own device for instance most of the screws are Phillips but there's these random ones like the one on the top right most side to the taptic engine that random screw right there is a trying bed. There's also a hidden screw underneath the camera connection the logic boards actually under some foam so if you're doing one of these yourself be sure to remove that screw. logic board and dock connector I can install the smaller components like the Wi-Fi antenna and the brackets that go over the connection to the volume and power button flex cable with that done it's time to move on to the LCD which is cracked so I'll need to swap that over while doing that I'll also need to swapped over the home button but be very careful because this is a device specific button. oddly flimsy compared to previous generations and Apple trying to deter us from repairing our own phones we've got try wing screws throughout the display assembly. When the iPhone 8 was released and in early versions of iOS 11 if you put a third-party display on to the iPhone aka a display that isn't paired to the device itself your iPhone would not boot Apple got sued for this of course and now they've removed that with a software update so we can actually change our displays it's amazing. from when the phone was last assembled and I can attach the display and earpiece to the device reinstall the appropriate brackets. I'm also in going to install an iPhone 5 battery adhesive strip which makes the battery removal process a lot easier plus I didn't have an iPhone 8 one laying around so I had to opt for this option. it looks absolutely spelling comparing this to the iPhone 7 you can see the difference between the aluminum and the glass. Let me know down the comments what do you prefer the red and whites or thered and black displays.",

      "title": "iPhone 8 Battery Replacement - iPhone 8 Battery Repair How To - Simple Guide",
      "transcript": "We've been sent this iPhone 8 and it's in for \na battery replacement when we head to settings,   battery then battery health we get 84% maximum \ncapacity. Which I mean do they really need one?! So we turn the phone off, \nunscrew the two pentalobe screws   at the bottom and stick the jimmy tool \nin between the screen and the frame so   that we get a gap that we can fit the guitar \npick in to break the seal around the edges. Once the seal's broken we can just give \nit a little wiggle, pull it upwards   and it opens like a book where we can see \nthat somebody has been here before us.   They left their stickers all over \nthe place and missing screws.   My next best bit of advice when you're doing \nany battery replacement will be to get some 99.9   pure isopropyl alcohol and just douse it \nunderneath the battery so that when you've got the   screws out and you took the screen off it's going \nto make it really nice and easy for us to get the   pull tabs underneath. Four screws that we need to \nunscrew on the lcd plate then we use the plastic   pry tool to disconnect the battery and the two lcd \nconnectors then move up to the top of the phone   where we can unscrew the three screws, remove the \nplate and detach the front sensor flex. Now that   the screen's out of the way it means that we can \nget the plastic stick tool under those pull tabs and pull away the adhesive strips underneath. \nI like to give them a little wiggle whilst   I’m pulling them upwards and it \njust seems to reduce the chance   of snapping them although on this one I definitely \nsnapped it but we got 90% of it out before so I’m   not gonna wrestle underneath it or do the pry \nof shame just for that little bit of adhesive.   Moving on to the top these are a little \nbit trickier to get off around here because   the actual strips don't wrap all the way \naround the battery and the tape on it is   much finer so you have to battle a little bit \nwith the plastic stick to get underneath them. But once you through the adhesive you can just \npull them out like the other ones and because   we've already doused it in the alcohol they come \nout quite nice and easily and once the strips are   pulled out we can just get the plastic pry tool \nagain underneath the battery and pull it upwards   we've just got that last bit \nof adhesive what we snapped   off to clear off and then dry up any \nexcess alcohol that's left behind   now that the battery is removed we're going to \nwork on the edges of the chassis removing any   leftover adhesive from last time so that our \nnew adhesive will stick nicely to the frame I use a mixture of the plastic stick and   a little chisel sort of scalpel tool with some \nisopropyl alcohol to get any stubborn bits away   once all the thick bits of adhesive have \nbeen removed we can use a cotton bud   with some isopropyl alcohol just to get any \nlast bits of dirt grime glue off of the frame   and with it now clean we can get our adhesive \nsheet and line it up and stick it into place   i use a plastic stick again to make sure that the \nadhesive is stuck all the way around the edges and   it just makes it easier to peel it off later on \nif it's stuck all the way down peel back the first   layer of the adhesive and now it's time to get our \nnew battery we're using these ones from iParts 4   so pretty decent batteries would recommend them \nand they rarely let us down I always stick the   adhesive to the back of the battery first \nand then drop it into place in the housing it's important to peel the right part of these \nsheets we always go for the blue side first and   then it keeps the sort of strips in the right \nplace so that we can stick it onto the back of   the battery and then peel it off afterwards then \npull the blue parts of the front tabs off and just   fold them over the front of the battery try and \nkeep that as neat as possible because if they   fold and leave if you make a mess with them you \ndo leave yourself at risk of leaving sort of   pressure marks underneath the screen so it's \nimportant to do this part neatly once that's   done we can bring the phone back connect the \nbattery flex first and then drop the battery   into the sort of cradle for it that means that \nyou're not going to get any alignment problems but make sure that you disconnect the battery \nagain before you connect the lcd back to the phone   and the front sensor once all the flex cables are   reattached we can start screwing back \ndown the plates for the front sensor and the lcd battery charge port connectors too once everything's screwed down we can turn \nthe phone back on and while that's booting   up we can remove the rest of the adhesive ready \nto slot the screen back into place from the top   and then the sides get the two pentalobe \nscrews back in the bottom of the device   and now when we head to settings and battery health we can see that we're back to \n100 maximum capacity test that it charges okay and then give it a clean before \nwe return this one back to   our customer thank you as always for watching our \nvideos if you found it useful give it a thumbs up   if there's any questions leave them in \nthe comments or send me an email thankyou",

Once the seal's broken we can just give it a little wiggle, pull it upwards and it opens like a book. Using the plastic stick tool we can remove the screen from the phone. The adhesive strips underneath are a little harder to get off than the battery. We managed to get 90% of the adhesive off before snapping the screen. Once the battery is removed we're going to work on the edges of the chassis removing any leftover adhesive from last time so that our new adhesive will stick nicely to the frame. I use a mixture of the plastic stick and a little chisel sort of scalpel tool with some isopropyl alcohol to get any stubborn bits away. Picking up the new battery it's important to peel the right part of these sheets we always go for the blue side first and then it keeps the sort of strips in the right place so that we can stick it onto the back of the battery. If you make a mess with them you do leave yourself at risk of leaving sort of pressure marks underneath the screen. means that you're not going to get any alignment problems but make sure that you disconnect the battery again before you connect the lcd back to the phone and the front sensor. Once all the flex cables are reattached we can start screwing back down the plates for the front sensors and the lCD battery charge port connectors too. Once everything's screwed down we can turn the phone back on and while that's booting up we can remove the rest of the adhesive ready to slot the screen back into place.",

while we're happy that many components form a modular the new layout and placement seems like a near impossible game of pick-up sticks so the new glass pack is interesting not only is it home to the qi wireless charging coil but underneath the coil is the Apple logo that's embedded in the middle of the glass so minor scratches well far the logo at all backing the glass is a metal frame that provides structural support and should make it more durable based on Apple's patent filings I think they might be using some kind of liquid metal nano coating which would be pretty sweet but unfortunately we don't have the equipment to verify that but regardless of whether they're using liquid metal the back is glass and it's going to break as you can see here here and here repairability for this phone is more important than any phone since the iPhone 4s which is why we've got one more thing the score the iPhone 8 plus earned a 6 out of 10 on our repairability scale and here's why the display and battery are straightforward to access with the proper knowledge and tools wireless charging means less wear on the all purpose lightning port a common point of failure water and dust seals complicate repair but make the need for difficult liquid damage repairs less likely the battery connector still uses common Phillips JIS fasteners but you'll still need up to four different drivers for many repairs and despite alleged durability the back glass is breakable and next to impossible to replace when cracked and lastly the iPhones lower components once readily removed now light trapped under a fussy combination of brackets and delicately folded flex cables so was the iPhone 8 plus everything you thought it would be all of our Apple tear downs are just getting started so if you haven't already click that subscribe button follow us on Twitter at iFixit and give us a like on facebook at facebook.com slash iFixit we'll see you soon",

      "transcript": "hi welcome simon here and hope you're doing well in this video i'll walk you through step by step on how to do a screen replacement on an iphone 8 plus if you take a closer look here on the top right corner i do have a correct screen and let's go ahead and get started so the first thing you like to do is to turn off the phone and get yourself a pentalobe p2 screwdriver which is the 0.8 has a little five pointy stuff on it so 0.8 that would be removing the two screws here at the very bottom right next to the charging port once you have removed that two screws the next step is to go ahead and get yourself a metal prying tool and this is to pry open the screen so what you want to do is you want to stick it in between that screen and the phone right about this much here so try not to put too deep because you do not want to damage the internal part of the phone all you want to do is to cut the adhesive all around the phone by doing so so the phone is water resistant it prevents the dust or any water liquid going into the phone so that adhesive is holding down the screen so using the metal prying tool allows you to cut that adhesive open now once you have cut the adhesive you can turn the phone to your right which is open at 90 degree angle holding down the screen while you're removing the rest of the screws what you need to do is to get a phillips screwdriver and let's go ahead and start removing the screws here the screws are in different sizes so make sure you're not mix matching the screw and therefore you might have difficult time to put them back together so align the screws make sure you know where it comes from and then install it back after now once you have removed the four screws this metal bracket would just come right off okay so unfortunate that this bracket is kind of come off together with that lcd screen well that is okay because we're gonna remove it in a second but what i wanted to point out to you is the second cable from the bottom which is this one here that is the battery so let's go ahead and disconnect the battery and push that on the side now you do need to have a tri screwdriver or the y screwdriver and this is to remove the two wire screws here on the top which is holding down the year speaker and the front camera once you have removed the two screws go ahead and push the metal bracket here on the side we're going to need that in just a second once you have disconnect all of that this is pretty much the entire screen now the very next step is we need to transfer the home button to the new screen okay so let's go ahead and do do so i'm using the white screwdriver i believe this is the 0.6 wide screwdriver once you've done that process what we need to do is to disconnect the connector you want to flip the connector to your left like so and lift this extension connector here upwards while holding that down we are getting the prying tool we're going to go underneath that cable okay and then push that home button drop from the front we're going to transfer this to the new screen now the next step to transfer would be the front camera and the year speaker getting a phillips screwdriver let's start removing all the screws there are five screws in total once you have removed that remove the bracket get the camera flip it across on the other side of the on the left remove the year speaker now let's go ahead and start digging the piece all together okay so what you want to do is to remove the entire cable including the cable here right underneath that little four gold dots you see that four dots right there so what you want to do is you want to remove that all together as well go underneath them and remove the entire cable once you have done that process we are pretty much ready to transfer over to the new screen so bring the new screen here realign the cable what you want to do is make sure that two little dots are aligned with the two little holes so that all the cables can sit right into it once you have done that process make sure the proximity sensor the ambient light sensor is seated properly once you feel that it is sitting flush to that phone get your year speaker the golden part of it will be aligning with the bottom here and then flip over the camera to your right once you've done that process get the bracket back down installing it and finish up with the screws now the new screen that i got it comes with the back plate meaning that this metal back plate or this one here okay you can either transfer from the original or you can buy one that comes with it so i'm lazy and i just buy the one that comes with it therefore i do not have to transfer them but if you feel like you get a better deal without having the metal plate by all means get that and transfer it later on it's pretty straightforward there's nothing uh that difficult to transfer the back plate and i'll show it to you in just a second once i get all the screws back in here all right so pretty much you just use the tri screwdriver or the y remove the three screws on each side of the back plate one two and three and therefore you can just transfer the original back plate over okay so that being said let's go ahead and put the home button back to the screen so you want to come in from the front and you want to make sure the extension connector is flipped up let it sit on top of the home button and then kind of close it down okay so let it sit here close it down transfer the home button bracket back together because we need to secure fasten that bracket there if you're still following along the video so far you're doing very good well done you're almost done this is about more than half the process is done the next step is to just installing odd uh installing them back together okay so the next step is to reconnect the cable back to the front here you can just they're kind of like lego align them in a position you do not have to push it and force it down if you have them in the right position they're like lego they'll snap back to the phone itself so just align them in a position like so and last but not least the battery double check make sure everything is in the right place now the final step is to transfer the bracket the metal bracket that was removed a second ago so transfer them back together get your phillips screwdriver the long screw is going down to the very bottom here the rest of it can go back the shorter one can go back to to the far right this one is right in the center and this one tiny little screw goes back to the very top once you have done that process let's go ahead and get this one the bracket here on the top using the tri screwdriver and final step is to align your front bracket you see that three little metal thing bracket you need to align them on the top make sure you're aligning and holding down the top while you're crunching down all around the corner just press it down and the phone will just snap back in once you have that in a position you can start powering on the phone okay i think the battery just went out let's put the two screw back together and there you have it we just change out the iphone 8 plus let's put the screw back in first here okay we just replaced the iphone 8 plus crack screen and if you find the video is helpful please go ahead and smash the like button for me and i really appreciate you for doing that uh comment below and let me know how did you do with the screen replacement and um and if you're not sure where to buy the tools from let's go ahead and

      "transcript": "here we have an iphone 8 plus that came in for no power we already disassembled the board and what i want to do is plug power externally and see what readings we got on that meter we're going to be using the mechanic iboot device you can also find this device on our website northridgefix.com click on shop and search for iboot it looks something like this and let's go ahead and plug the connector it plugs in to the charging flex connector and to the battery connector right now the meter is showing zero because nothing is happening all right so i have both the charging connector and the battery connector connected right here and that's the flux cable and if we try to power the device on it does not power on i see zero nothing is happening no amp draw nothing so we may have a short on the board and that's why we're not able to turn that device on let me put this on the side let's start by doing a quick measurement in the tigress area here maybe we can measure vdd main meter in diode mode we can measure vdd main right here and look at that we have a short we can also measure it here and we can also measure it right over here very short just as i expected we were not able to turn on the device and the amp meter was showing zero the short could be coming from a lot of places it could be coming from this trip here it could be coming from tigress it could be coming from the chip next to it it could be coming from any one of the caps that connects with those chips possibilities are endless how can we pinpoint where the short is coming from why don't we inject voltage at the shorted cap and then we're gonna monitor the board under a thermal camera and see what gets hot that would be the fastest way if we do not do this then it's really a trial and error it's difficult to figure out where the shot is coming from in a quick manner unless we use this method voltage injection and thermal camera one two and inject something is getting hot let me zoom in by using digital zoom look at this as soon as i point my probe on the right something on the left is getting hot and that's our tiger trip so we found it the problem is our theorist chip it would have been difficult to figure out where the shirt is coming from if it wasn't for the thermal camera we on this channel are the ones who made the thermal camera popular and finding shorts using a thermal camera and everybody else followed so we have a problem with the tigaris right here let's dissolve the chip we're gonna apply a tiny bit of flux and we're gonna solder a new chip and hope for the best but first before we do let's go ahead and check do we still have a short we want to confirm that removing this trip released our short nice we still have a short day two i had to leave this board yesterday because we were running out of time and we still have a short we removed tigaris and we still have a short the thermal camera did point us to tigger race but it looks like something else is causing the short and causing figures to get hot or maybe tigress was bad to begin with we do not know let's take a look under the thermal camera again and see what is getting hot on the board we're going to inject about 1.4 volts at the shorter area of the cap and see what happens we can inject voltage at any one of the shorted caps they all share the same line the ones i pointed to let's see we do see a heat spot let me do a digital zoom with my thermal camera this is not an optical zoom it's a digital zoom so we're gonna lose quality as we zoom in but that's okay i do not have a macro lens for this thermal camera and i should be using the unity thermal camera with the macro lens it gives me a better view of what's getting hot but since i have this one right now let's go ahead and work with it what is getting hot okay so i'm pointing to the shorted cab that's here on the right and something on the left is getting hot something right here it looks like one of the two caps yeah one of the two caps right here the thermal camera is pointing me right over here it could be this one or it could be this one maybe we can start with the bottom one and see if that will solve the problem if not then we will remove this one and see if that releases our short i went outside to speak to a customer i came back and i forgot to put the microphone on so the last part i did did not have any sound what can you do so let's go ahead and test i'm gonna plug the power cable flux and the battery right there the battery and the charging flex and we're gonna connect this cable to our iboot machine and before if you remember the reading was zero let's try to turn it on and see if this board is working now ready yes yes it's working when you press and hold you need to press and hold and then let go and the phone is working it's booting up right now the reading is going to go up to 0.3 0.5 0.7 and then it's going to jump over one amp and then it will settle back down to 0.3 amp and that tells me that the board is working it went over one amp and now it's settling back down 0.4 0.3 awesome and i can feel the board is hot the cpu is on we did it i'm going to give this board the big buzz to resemble and test and i'll be back to finish the video amazing big boss raise some of the phone and tada phone is working phone is fully functional customers gonna be very happy we're gonna invoice and mail this back to the customer that's it we're gonna end the video right here i hope you enjoyed it don't forget to like and subscribe leave a comment have any questions and

      "transcript": "alright guys how's it going I was not expecting to make this video you see I consider myself a very cautious person with my phone and I make fun of people who drop their phone I think how do you drop your phone like just just hold it just be careful with it it's you just you know be careful but you see I was trying on clothes and I took off my jeans to try and send different pants and I was folding them over my arm and I you don't just like folding them trying to compress them so I could set him down I heard a loud crack or a thud almost like a gunshot I would describe it as it was extremely loud and well my phone fell on the hardest floor in the building and right on the corner it did not bounce it fell hard and so as you can see from the footage I'm no doubt showing right now wow it was messed up man it was it was messed up so yeah I was I was pretty sad pretty upset and I was I was in deep depression but I looked it up and I realized this actually looks like a decent enough repair you know I'm not scared of repairing things by myself and I'm guessing if you're watching this video you're not too scared of it either or maybe you're scared of it and you need someone else to hold your hand I'll be that person but it's a super simple repair I think anyone can do it so I feel like I've wasted way too much time all right so it's time to begin the repair and well yeah as you can see the phone is still quite damaged and you can see like just trying to use the screen for anything it just goes crazy open the apps you know there's artifacting all over the screen and they're still black and yeah it's it's pretty bad but yeah so it's time to start the repair we're gonna start by turning it off I wasn't able to actually turn it all the way off because I couldn't tap the button but I just turned it off normally I'm not sure if this is the safest procedure but as I said not really sure how to turn it all the way off but I have an exacto knife here and we're gonna start just prying the screen off and since it's already cracked this will be a pretty easy process so I'm just gonna poke it in there and pry it up a little bit slide my razor blade down it a little bit as you can see the screen is just starting to come off and as I said if your screen isn't actually cracked this will be harder and you might have to use a little bit of heat but I think most people are replacing my screens it's probably broken so that makes it a lot easier for someone who wants to take it apart for a repair so yeah as I said I'm just sliding down I'm cutting the adhesive and I'm trying to pry the screen off and this is a pretty simple repair compared to some others like you know iPhone repair as you can see it's starting to give way a little bit and I can start separating it with my fingers and as you can see the ribbon is right there and I have the screen to where it's a it's about to a bookshelf fold but that side still hanging on pretty good especially because it isn't cracked so I'm just work for second and trying to get that off just gonna back and forth that I'm examining it you know trying to find where the weak point is and I kind of found it so I'm gonna pull up from that edge and so I can slowly pry it off there we go it popped off let's see the adhesive was still stringing on there and so now we're to the actual ribbon so I'm just going to get ready to take that off I got to grab my screwdriver a Phillips small one mine's a little smaller than one you would probably want to use for this but that just means I had to apply a little more pressure and this one's also not magnetic which is really annoying but you know it's a very short repair there's only two screws to take apart which is miles ahead any phone I've ever taken apart so just got out you know poke it out of there and then the connector comes off like a little Lego and there we go the screen is off I was checking to see if that metal bracket was adhered it is and there's another one on the replacement screen and so I'm just lining it up real quick I grabbed my box and I'll open up oh my goodness there's literally a helicopter outside while I'm voice recording that never happens there's really a helicopter okay never mind that or you know we're gonna keep going as you can see I'm taking the screen out of the package there it is a little bit of bubble wrap and it's in a plastic sleeve so I would say and we're just gonna pull that off it also has a plastic coating over it so I'm just gonna make sure I don't you know it's very reflective on the back I'm just gonna try and get that plastic piece off of the back so that I don't push it down with the plastic piece in the way and then I'm gonna try to put that connector on although putting it on was a little more difficult but as before snaps on like a little Lego but but this one's a little bit of a harder piece you know Oh worst Lego so yeah just putting some pressure on it trying to line it up you know trying to deal with holding the screen at the same time it's just the annoying part and so as the ribbon cable I'm fighting I'm trying to snap it on but you should be very careful with the ribbon cable because it's like you know it's like paper you don't want to rip it and if you rip it the screen is quite dead so yeah just try to figure out how I can screw this on kind of a pain and the magnetism really hurts me but I got it in there without any magnets and just put in a lot of pressure as I said my screwdrivers not quite the right size so a little bit more pressure needed for me and one last screw to finish almost the whole repair really it's as I said very simple so put that last screw in I want to note that I don't have any type of adhesive I wanted to show a you know me putting a different type of adhesive on there but I don't know where it is so yeah right now the screen repair is done as you can see it's a working screen it's just that you'll have to apply glue with your Liberty I wouldn't use like superglue but just some type of basic adhesive and some of the screen kits even come with tools and you know adhesive so yeah I think that's pretty much going to wrap up the repair as I said I've done harder Paris this one seemed to be on the easier side for me and now I'm just happy to have my phone back just peel that was nice mm-hmm as you can see it's in full working and with touch and everything and I can't see a single defect there's a little bit of the backlight bleeding through because I didn't have it all the way pushed in and yeah it looks just like the original and I'm happy it's fixed so now led us into the outro so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed that tutorial and that helps you to repair your own phone I will leave repair parts down below I'll leave some on Amazon with my affiliate link so I get a very small kickback like 1 to 3% if you buy it from there but I'll also leave eBay links because I'm pretty sure eBay is cheaper

      "title": "OnePlus 5 Teardown – Screen Repair, Battery Replacement Fix video",
      "transcript": "The OnePlus 5, the Android phone named after\na first grade math problem, is on my desk and ready to be taken apart. Let’s get started. OnePlus is still using the rare T2 bit that\nis not normally included with most cellphone repair kits. I’ll link a kit that includes the bit in\nthe video description. The build of the OnePlus 5 is pretty similar\nto the iPhone which has 2 little screws at the bottom. Then I can slip my metal pry tool between\nthe plastic rim of the screen and the metal edge of the phone. It’s still very securely snapped into place\nso this takes a little bit of aggressive persuasion. I switched to a plastic tool in the middle\nof the process to avoid scratching the metal because I would hate to do any damage to this\nphone. And definitely take out the SIM card tray\nbefore you attempt any of this. Once we get that last clasp undone we get\nour first glimpse at the non-red battery. OnePlus used to include a brilliant red battery\ninside the OnePlus One and the OnePlus 2, but stopped with the red battery after the\nOnePlus X. The OnePlus 3 didn’t have it either. I guess OnePlus didn’t get the memo that\ninternal beauty is just as important as external beauty. I have nothing against yellow, but red is\ndefinitely more cool. One interesting thing is that the charging\nport and the headphone jack are still attached to the back panel. Removing one Phillips head screw allows me\nto pull off the silver metal bracket on the motherboard and unclip the charging port. There are 4 screws holding the two components\nonto the back panel and once those are gone the ribbons can pull free. This is extremely convenient because the charging\nport and the headphone jack are some of the first things that stop working on a cellphone\na couple years down the road, so it’s nice that they have easy replaceable access. There’s a little rubber ring around the\ncharging port, but I would assume this is to protect the port from stress of plugging\nand unplugging and nothing to do with water resistance. There’s no adhesive around the port or around\nthe lip of the screen, so I would not trust this phone anywhere near water. We still have no access to remove the battery\nyet but we can unplug it. Eight normal Phillips head screws need to\nbe removed from the motherboard. I’ll unsnap two more ribbon cables; they\njust unclip like little Legos. And one black wire cable. Finally the board can lift away from the frame,\ngiving us access to unsnap the one remaining extension ribbon hidden on the back. I’m using my plastic pry tool for all of\nthis so I don’t hurt any of the fragile electronics. The dual camera set up comes with two individual\nribbons. The regular 16 megapixel camera is on the\nleft and the 20 megapixel telephoto camera is on the right. Neither of which have the optical stabilization. All of the shake reduction is done internally\n- electronically, which isn’t always my favorite. The front facing camera also has that same\nelectronic image stabilization, no OIS, but it does come with 16 megapixels of its own. I’ll snap the rear cameras back in like\nlittle Legos and then move back to the body of the phone. The little silver circular guy is the vibration\nmotor. And now we have access to the extremely average\nlooking, yellow and silver colored battery. I don’t read Chinese real good, but I’m\ngoing to assume this tab means “pull”. Luckily no heat is required for the removal\nof this battery. There are no magical pull tabs but it’s\nstill pretty user-friendly. I’ll give OnePlus a thumbs up for that. Making our way down to the bottom of the phone,\nthere are 6 screws holding in the loudspeaker. It’s a thin little guy with two golden contact\npads on the back to receive the signal. The extension ribbon can come loose and then\nthe larger ribbon on the left. The last little connection is probably for\nthe capacitive buttons on the front of the screen. In the past, OnePlus replacement screens came\nwithout the frame installed, so to complete a screen repair you’d have to heat up the\nold display, remove it from the frame of the phone, and reuse the same frame with your\nnew display. You can check the video description for replacement\nscreens. I’m going to leave my display intact because\nthe old screen will not survive the removal process and mine still works just fine. Now that the new screen is on I’ll clip\nthe 3 ribbon cables down into place including the extension ribbon for the motherboard. And I’ll screw in the loudspeaker. This loudspeaker does not have the waterproofing\nmesh that we’ve seen in water resistant phones like the iPhone 7, Samsung or even\nthe HTC U11. So once again, I would not trust this phone\naround water. There has been some false speculation floating\naround out there that this is a water-resistant phone, and that’s just not true. The boring battery is back in place though. Before I can set the motherboard down I do\nhave to attach the extension ribbon cable to the underside of the board. After that’s clipped in I can drop the board\ndown into the frame. I’ll connect a few more ribbon cables and\nthen the one wire cable, and make sure all those screws get back into place. Over here on the back metal panel, we have\nthe charging port and the headphone jack that need to be screwed with their 4 screws. And I can plug it back into the motherboard\nright next to the battery connection. Both of those connectors get covered by the\nmetal bracket and that last motherboard screw. Getting the screen to pop back in the frame\nwas easiest for me by lining up the top first, getting those clips in place and then pressing\ndown along the sides very carefully. Overall it was very nice opening up a phone\nthat didn’t require a heat gun. I might not approve of the battery color or\nthe lack of optical image stabilization, and it is kind of nice to have water resistance\non a phone, but I am a fan of this phone in general. If you haven’t seen the durability test,\ngo check that out. And subscribe for more videos like this in\nthe future. It’s free and I have plenty more videos\ncoming. Thanks a ton for watching. I’ll see you around.",

sim tray and pull it out the oneplus 5 consists of a back cover and a display unit all the electronics and the screen are installed in the display unit the back cover is designed as a case to lift off the back cover you need a suction cup a flat opening tool and a pick if the screen is badly cracked cover it with a strip of packing tape so that the suction cup can stick attach the suction cup over the home button pull on the suction cup and then slide the opening tool between the display and the rear panel if the opening tool is too soft use a pick when a small gap appears insert the pick you best use a hard pick with a stopper so that it doesn't slip too far into the device now run the pick around the whole frame you can twist the pick a little to lever off the display the device is not glued but clipped use the pick to release the clips one by one once all the clips are released you can lift off the back cover the tabs at the upper edge come out last the rear case is still connected with a flex cable gently fold open the back cover and hold it to protect the cable the connectors for the battery at the back cover are under a bracket remove the screw from the bracket and then remove the bracket it's latched in on both ends first disconnect the battery to avoid short circuits use a plastic tool for this then disconnect the second connector it connects the usb port to the main board remove the phillips screws on the speaker unit then pry out the speaker with a flat tool now you can take it out of the device first disconnect all connectors from the main board unplug the antenna connector with a slight twist of the tweezers disconnect the connector of the large flex cable from the motherboard and the small coaxial plug of the wi-fi antenna next to the camera remove the phillips screws from the main board one of the screws has a moisture indicator sticker you can remove the sticker and reuse it later or just throw it away unplug the flex cable running over the

bend the battery the battery is not stuck very hard should the glue still be hard to remove you can heat the unit from the display side now remove the long antenna cable from the device first carefully remove the contact from the bottom board for the volume keys there is still a tape strip over the cable once you've removed that you can pull the cable out from its holder then remove the small flex cable on top of the device carefully slide the steel spatula between the cable and frame to release the cable then unplug the remaining connector from the sub board heat the sub board to release the glue use a flat tool to gradually release the sub board from the case be very careful the cable is very sensitive then put the sub board aside next remove the large flex cable from the device first unplug the connector then pull off the transparent tape for the battery you can reuse the tape in the new display heat the flex cable to release the adhesive then release the flex cables from the device using a steel spatula be careful not to damage the cable heat the cable several times to release the glue now check the spare part to see which parts you still need your replacement display may already come with a vibration motor and earpiece and the flex cables for the buttons in this case you can skip to the next steps the vibration motor is lightly glued in so you can use hot air again then use a spatula to release the vibrator's flex cable very carefully and then remove it from its socket take the vibrator out of the device pry the earpiece out with a flat tool and then take it out remove the tape over the volume buttons use the spatula to release the volume keys the keys are slightly glued here you can use hot air again also use the spatula to release the glued flex cable and take the keys out of the device now do the same on the other side for the standby button first remove the tape over the cable then use hot air and the steel spatula to remove the flex cable for the standby button check if you have to reuse any small parts such as plastic puzzles or spacers from the old display if so remove the parts from the old display and insert them into the new one remove all protective films from the replacement part we're not using a new spare part for this video because our old display is still working fine the process is just the same for the new display though first pressing the flex cable for the standby button gently press it down to make it stick also stick the contacts to the case a small opening over the contacts helps you position them then put the tape over the button again now do the same for the volume buttons and on the other side place the flex cable in the device gently press it down to make it stick also press in the contacts then attach the tape back over the buttons put the earpiece in its hole and press it in to make it stick the golden spring contacts must be facing down place the vibration motor in its opening and press it

stick put the adhesive foil for the battery over the flex cable and press it on plug in the connector of the flex cable with your finger be careful not to bend any of the sensitive pins the connector should click into place insert the sub board into the device and press it on all over to make it stick then connect the plug put the small antenna flex cable back in its place and press it in to make it stick place the antenna cable in its guide then attach the black tape strip over the antenna cable place the plug over its socket and press it on you should feel a slight snap put the battery in

small antenna to the top of the main board then plug the connector of the flex cable to the main board position the plug of the antenna cable and gently press it on so that you feel a slight snap be careful not to slip with the connectors as the small pins may get damaged you should feel the connectors engage with a light snap put the speaker in its place and fasten it the screws are all the same lengths so you can't swap them attach the rear case at the right angle and plug the usb port connector to the main board also connect the battery connector to the main board now put on the bracket make sure it's latched in on both ends fasten the screw of the bracket now attach the back cover to the display unit slide in the upper edge first the back cover has three tabs here clipping the

fasten the two screws to the left and right of the usb port check the minimum and maximum brightness of the display and check for pixel errors drag any app across the screen in a zigzag pattern if it

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8+ - How to Take Apart &amp; Replace LCD Glass Screen Replacement",
      "transcript": "hello everyone in this video I'm going to be showing you how to replace your glass and LCD screen assembly on your Samsung Galaxy S8 plus all right so I'm going to be showing you how to take it apart and place a screen on it first thing we're going to need to do is we're going to need to give it some heat on the back cover to remove it so we can either do this with a heat gun or a hair dryer uh by moving it around slowly I'll keep it around uh around four or five inches away from it so we don't burn the foam or we can put it on a hot plate like I am going to show you this is what I do since I have a hot plate and I will put it to about 110 Dees celius for about 2 to 3 minutes and make make sure that you power the phone off before we begin to give it heat and then once we're ready begin the procedure and then I'm going to show you how to remove the back cover once it's hot enough all right so what we're going to do is we're going to get a suction cup and begin to pull up on the back glass until you see a slight opening where we can stick a uh pick or pre tool and then once you have the pre tool in there uh you can remove the suction cup and then we're going to go around the back around all the sides uh with uh the prime tool or several Prime tools okay once you see that you have uh most of it the priming tool going around the entire frame once you see you have most of it uh lifted up you can go ahead and pull up on the back uh glass from the bottom towards the top and it will come right out all right so let's remove uh let's remove the adhesive uh and let's place it back in place on the back cover so that we can reuse it again all right next thing we're going to need to do is remove all of the Phillips head screws that are holding on the back uh frames of the Pham so we're going to remove all the philps head screws and put them to the side all right next thing we're going to do is we're going to pry up on the uh back frame we want to pull up on them gently they will come right out when they uncp it's going to have a little bit of adhesive tape there you're going to pull up on it and it will come right out and then on the bottom um portion we're also going to have to pry up on it gently maybe wiggle it um sideways so it can come out easier there you go and it'll come right out so next thing we need to do is disconnect the battery to make sure there's no electricity going through the phone all right next thing we want to do is get the new screen so that we can test it out before we um install it completely so let's go ahead and make sure the phone's uh powered on let's disconnect the old LCD and connect the new one all right and then once it's connected go ahead and uh press the power button so that the screen can light up so we can test out the LCD and the touch function all right so it looks like the LCD is lighting up correctly so let's test out the touch function as well to make sure that's working okay once uh you're ready go ahead and disconnect the battery again to disconnect electricity and disconnect the LCD C the LCD cable all right so next thing we're going to need to do is we're going to need to give it some heat again once again this time on the screen uh either use a hair dryer heat gun or place it on the hot plate until it's hot enough all right so once it's hot enough we're going to get a open PR tool once again and begin prying up uh you can start towards the top remember that the flex cable is going to be towards the bottom on the right hand side so we're going to begin to pry up on the top portion P pulling up and this is a broken LCD screen the one where we're moving so I'm not going to be too gentle with it um because I don't don't care about it breaking so we're going to go around the entire screen all right until it's completely removed all right once you see that the top portion is removed uh that you can stick the finger in there you can begin to pry up on it completely pull up on it harder so that it comes off easier this this uh S8 and S8 plus does have a stronger adhesive holding the screen in I noticed than the previous Models All Right Next Thing Once you remove the the screen off completely uh we're going to make sure that there's no leftover glass around the frame so that we when we install the new screen it won't be damaged by anything left over on the old frame so make sure you clean it up make sure on all the sides there's nothing left all right once it's clean and you're sure that you're ready to put the new screen in let's go ahead and remove the uh plastic films from the new screen all right and we're going to go ahead and place the LCD Cable in first through the slot also make sure you put some tape uh on the new LCD where the chips are to make sure that there's no contact with the frame because sometimes that makes the phone the screen malfunction all right so once that's ready place the cable in through the slot okay and then position the frame correctly on the frame and then give it some little bit of pressure around all the sides so that it can uh be glued down with the adhesive correctly go around all the sides all right once uh the screen is positioned in correctly and you have connected the flex cable connect the battery back as well connect the LCD cable make sure everything is connected all right uh you may want to give it a little bit of pressure one more time to make sure that the screen fits in correctly and then we're going to begin placing the back cover pieces back on so the loudspeaker on the bottom here we can place a screw down to secure it okay and then we're going to place the top portion over here which is is where the wireless uh Cable wireless adapter cable goes all right and let's go ahead and place all of the Phillips head screws back on the entire uh back frame all right so once you have all the back the screws back in we're going to need to connect uh the cable here all right this is for the sensor the fingerprint sensor on the back so we're going to need to connect this in the motherboard first before we put the back uh glass back on so let's connect that place it there very gently and slowly uh you may want to press it down with something uh maybe a small screwdriver once you your shirt it's clicked in uh you can go ahead and just give pressure around the back housing the back uh glass so that it can go back in its place all right so make sure that uh the phone is uh the back glass is back on correctly once you're done you go ahead and power the phone on test it on and make sure that everything is working fine all right so that's how you replace LCD screen on your Samsung Galaxy S8 plus hope this video was helpful if it was please give it a like And

      "title": "How to Replace the Battery on a Samsung Galaxy S8+",
      "transcript": "hello everyone and hello everyone in this video I'm going to be showing you how to replace the battery on your Samsung Galaxy S 8 plus alright so I'm going to be removing this right here because this is a brand new phone alright so first thing we're going to want to do to begin to open up the Samsung Galaxy s8 or s8 plus is we're going to need to give it heat here around the back cover because it's going to have adhesive holding down the back glass to the frame of the phone you can do this either with a hairdryer or a heat gun by heating it around the edges until it's just hot enough that we touch it it burns a little bit not too much because you don't want to damage the interior of the phone if you're using a heat gun use it at least if you're using a heat gun don't use the highest temperature use it on medium because they're very strong if you're using a hairdryer you can use it on high always you use it at least 4 to 5 inches away from the phone and continue to move it around until it's hotter don't keep it in the same spot or you can also use a hot plate which is what I will be using and I will show you now how we're going to do this alright so I'm just going to get these Samsung Galaxy s8 I have a hot plate over here which I will set to 110 degrees I will place the phone on here with the back facing down ok and I'm going to wait until the temperature gets to about 110 degrees Celsius okay once it does it should be hot enough and I will begin to remove the back cover and I will show you how to do that alright so it looks like the phone is hot enough now let's sit on the hot plate for about a minute or two alright so once it's ready you may want to use a glove so you don't burn your hands with the hand you're holding we're going to get a suction cup like this we're going to place it towards the bottom where the charging port is okay and we're going to lift up on it gently slowly see if we see if it lifts up a little bit towards the bottom here yep I can see it lifting there a little bit so once you see it lifting like that a little bit you can go ahead and place a pineco in there okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to kind of just go around it slowly with the prying tool once you go around thing and you did this pilots going into this side now yeah all right so we're going to lift it up gently it is going to have a connector right here which is going to disconnect kind of disconnect from the connector right here when you lift it up okay once you have a list you can pull it up all right see this is the connector I'm talking about this connector goes right here so when it's time to put it back together we will have to connect it all right so once you have it taken apart like this what we're going to do is with a small Phillips head screwdriver we're going to be removing all of these screws holding down the back yeah all right once you have all of the screws taken out we will be removing the back pieces that are held on the back housing so we're going to begin to lift up over here I'm going to lift up on it lift up on the middle side right here it's going to be held down with some adhesive right here on the side we're going to lift that up this piece comes off in one piece okay and then we're going to lift up the bottom portion which is what the speaker comes right out okay so next thing next step we're going to need to do is we're going to need to remove disconnect the battery cable to make sure there's no electricity flowing through the phone lift you can pull it back a little bit like this no problem okay so to remove the battery next step we're going to need to take is we're going to need to give it some heat again this time on the screen we're going to need to give it a little bit of heat with either a hairdryer or heat gun like I mentioned previously or you can lay it on the hot plate like this alright we're going to give it some heat because that is going to stop in the adhesive that is holding down the battery to the frame all right so I'm going to go and do that now all right so once the phone is hot enough I left it on the hot plate again for about a minute or two we're going to go ahead and get a thin crying tool alright and we're going to place it here in between the battery and the frame there's a slight opening alright and we're going to lift up on the battery okay and stick it in there a little bit and pull up on it and the adhesive should come loose this adhesive on the new SI tan si plus is not as strong as the adhesive that was used on the previous galaxies on the s7 s7 edge and before alright so that's how you removed the samsung galaxy s 8 plus battery so once you're ready you're going to go ahead and get your new battery and just place it right back in you should have some adhesive left over so you're going to go ahead and place your new battery back in alright and connect it I'm going to go ahead and place all the back covers back on let's place the bottom one first with the speaker make sure there are no - make sure there are no screws make sure there are no screws around this piece right here because sometimes they get attached to the speaker by the magnet alright so let's go ahead and place this down here give it some pressure so that the clips go in their place alright now let's do the top portion ok now this right here is the connector for the wireless charging capability and this is the sensor right here so let's go ahead and place this here again go ahead and give it some pressure so let the clips fall into place alright perfect okay so once again now we're going to go ahead and place all of the Phillips head screws back on okay and then once we're ready we're going to go ahead and place the back cover back on we're going to have to connect this little flex cable again here alright so let's go ahead and do that now we're going to have to kind of get it here with our finger place your finger on in here so you can give a pressure and then we're going to move it towards the connector right here you can see that right there there's the connected I put my finger right here place it right there on top of the connector and press down on it until you feel it click alright there you go it clicked as you can see it's on there so once I went to town there remember the old back cover or the new one that you buy should have adhesive on it this is what's going to hold it together and seal for the water not to go back in so once you're ready you're going to place the back cover right on top of right on the back frame alright place it as well as you can on the back so that it lines up perfectly with the frame okay once you feel that you've lined it up correctly you can begin to give a pressure squeeze down around all the side so that it falls back into place and glues back down I like to go around it like this was pressure with two fingers right so there you go guys alright guys so that is how you replace the battery on your Samsung Galaxy s8 Plus hope this video was helpful to you if it was please give it a like and subscribe for more videos like this so next time guys",

      "transcript": "hi this is John with fix-it planet today we got a galaxy s 8 t mobile version and the screen is busted pretty good that's your fingerprint reader right there will point some things out about that later on volume power so we're gonna take to start by taking the back off and this is extremely difficult just you need to get it very hot and in the process of getting it very hot you want to avoid getting yourself burnt or anything like that you're gonna might need a little help from a friend to place the pic in there for you once you get a gap started otherwise you might find that difficult but you have to apply a lot of force just to get a gap started and you might need both hands for that so it does help if you have a friend standing nearby that can push the pic in for you once the gap is started so that's the part thing that got cut out you didn't get to see and I also didn't didn't really show the total time it took to heat up the back but you can see that I'm using a heat gun I did preheat it on a hot plate and then I used the heat gun to to get it even hotter there is a cable right along here for the fingerprint reader right in this areas you want to be careful that you don't mess that up that would be very bad mistake there's also a NFC antenna and you know it's probably okay if you get a little bit of a nick in it along the edges but if you tear that the NFC antenna your you're gonna have to replace it so just be mindful of that because there is some adhesive around the edge and a second a second layer of adhesive there's the NFC antenna is just sticking to the back separating that and there's some white adhesive around the edges there's also some black adhesive a little further in and so you don't have to get in pretty far now there's the pop connector right there for the fingerprint reader and so you want to be careful as you're removing that that you don't rip that cable right there now if you do a good job of removing the back you'll see that the adhesive is still in pretty good shape I'm just pointing out the fingerprint reader again it's very important not to damage that our tape our adhesive all around the edges here is in good shape so we'll be able to reuse that if you damage it or mess it up on a really bad you'll want to replace it get some fresh and just pointed out a bunch of screws we're going to take those screws out now they never want to come all the way out I don't know what it is about these Samsung's the screws always get stuck before they come out so I usually end up taking them out with tweezers sometimes you get lucky and they'll come out I don't know some of them do some of them don't it's very much like the s7 in a lot of ways but one of the nice things about the s8 I think anyway is that there's no more buttons down at the bottom it's it's all built into the software so you don't have to worry about that if you want to change out the charging port you would do essentially the same thing that we've done up to this point and then there's your NFC antenna we do have a little sticky adhesive on edges of that you want to go ahead and separate that be careful not to tear it like I said if you get a little Nick along the edge there it'll probably be fine but if you tear tear it completely yeah you're in gonna have to replace that so these little plastic caps are sort of fitted into the frame with little notches around the edges and they fit underneath the frame and you just pry those loose and it will come right out there's three separate pieces that sort of fit together like a puzzle along with the NFC antenna so once that's been removed you'll be able to get access to the charge port you'll be able to get access to the battery the motherboard first thing we're going to do is disconnect this battery and like I was sand the charge port down there at the bottom on the right hand side that's the video cable I just pointed out as you can see that matches that and anyway the bottom on the right hand side there is where the charge port is if you have to replace that you can actually do that now without removing the screen disconnect everything the two antennas is actually a third one there it's more like a pop connector style and we're going to disconnect the bottom of this motherboard from the charge port dock and forgot to take the SIM card out so sliding this board out is a little bit easier if you remember to take that out first yep there it is now I have to sort of reposition the board a little bit so I can get get that tray to pop out so you certainly don't want to forget that and then try to yank that board out of there so as you can see once that's removed it comes out pretty easily we'll set that to the side and now we'll be able to get access to the back of the screen through a small spot right here that we'll be able to push on and that will help us and get a small gap started once again to put our pick in there and at this point it really doesn't matter about the screen it's already damaged and so we don't care about trying to salvage or anything it is extremely thin so in this case they're actually separating the glass from the display there is a battery still attached here in this particular case you want to also be sure unless you want to remove the battery first that you don't puncture it cut it or damage it in any way as we know that can be a big problem very hazardous so the screen is actually stuck down all the way crying the whole surface of the back of the screen has adhesive so there's virtually no part of the screen that does not have some kind of adhesive on it so it sticks around the edges it sticks in the middle everywhere there's the battery again it is exposed to the backs of care if we don't put a tool into that and it's kind of nice not having to worry about the little buttons under the edge of the screen that can be easily torn or damaged in this case we don't have to worry about that you can see the burn spot on the display there so now the glass is actually just going to come right off by itself and then we're going to remove the rest of the display out from behind it which is very thin it is in layers so this isn't the whole the whole display but it is part of it and once again our adhesive is in good shape pretty well we're gonna go in and we're going to take out any bits of glass that might be left behind make sure there's nothing that could cause the screen to crack or prevent it from laying down flat on the frame so you can put fresh adhesive it's probably in many cases you may have to but if you do a good job of removing the screen you can keep all of that intact and it's still extremely extremely sticky and sometimes that can create a problem when you're trying to work on it if you apply any pressure at all it'll stick to your mat so you want to make sure your mats clean of any kind of glass or or other debris so it's not picking it up sticking to the adhesive so now what we're going to do is go ahead and just put all the things back that need to be there the the cameras the power button the antennas we're gonna reconnect this motherboard everything back the way it was before we took it out and then we're gonna test the display and another nice thing about the s8 here happens to be that once this board is is put in place it doesn't have to be removed to put the new screen on there's a large enough gap in there near the connector to slide the cable through you can see the frame is still sticking to the mat so we're just gonna do a quick test of the screen make sure it's okay this is you know not really necessary for the video but for the sake of from start to finish I just thought I would go ahead and leave that in because it is something that you should do before you put the screen down permanent or you may have a a real problem trying to get it back off if it is defective in any way so I've been had an s8 in here yet this is my first one I think any case I'm pretty sure it is I don't have it I haven't had an SI plus either but I thought I'd go ahead and do the video now since I happen to have one in here so there are some other you know teardown videos repair videos some things like that on on the internet that you can refer to if there's anything in this video that didn't didn't go over or cover something that you need to know it's a fairly new phone so there's not not a total listen I mean there's there's actually a lot out there but there's not as many as some older phones I don't know it's weird some of some of the older phones don't have hardly any videos either so I just did one that rugby pro a little while back and there's practically nothing out there on that but then again it's kind of like who cares you know right but I don't know maybe somebody can use it so there's a slot right there that the cables gonna slide through that's gonna make it easier on us we ought to take the board back out I want to make sure to connect this cable first make sure the connector is seated properly so it's not out of alignment and when I go to put the screen down permanent it's going to be stuck down good and it will not want to come off without doing damage so we just apply a little bit of pressure all over the screen but not enough to you know damage it we don't want to crack it again right so we don't put too much pressure but we want to apply a little bit of pressure all the way around and make sure everything is is connected and seated properly before we close it back up there's a little a little shaft right here this little thing I'm pointing at that can actually fall out and it did in this video if you happen to notice that at one point it drops out on the mat and I move it out of the way and we did put it back so you have to make sure that your let's turn this around so you have to make sure that if something unexpected happens that you're paying close attention to what you're doing so you'll catch it and you don't lose a part that needs to be somewhere in the phone just happen to notice that one piece does come out without a whole lot of effort now we can go ahead and put our screws back in and we'll get this back put back on reconnect the fingerprint sensor and we'll be wrapping it up here shortly after another good test now that we got the last screw in we'll be able to get our back reconnect the fingerprint sensor and and seat the back back down and I'm going to try to make it where you can see what's going on my fingers are just too too fat and too big to fit down in there properly and be able to to get that so we're going to use the spudger and we're gonna connect that with the spudger and then we'll put our finger back in and just check it and make sure it's all the way down it seated properly once I'm satisfied that's okay we'll go ahead and put the back down apply a little pressure back down around the hitches again all the way around and that bad boy is stuck down good it put our sim tray back in and we'll go for a final test chair so we'll check the cameras and we'll make sure it's charging okay and just gonna look around the edges make sure there's no gaps make sure everything's nice and seamless and it is very nice since there's no SIM card I can't really do a test phone call but it'll be alright you can do a more thorough test when you're doing this repair you can if you want go through practically every function but for the video we're just doing a few quick checks to show that this is all good working fine as long as you do everything carefully you should not shouldn't have any problems with the phone and we're charging it looks like I can't see it very well let's take a look there we go you can see the lightning bolt in the battery there but power it off and then we'll plug it in one more time so hopefully this video was helpful for it will be helpful for someone I appreciate you watching like subscribe share

The frame is still sticking to the mat so we're just gonna do a quick test of the screen make sure it's okay. videos some things like that on on the internet that you can refer to if there's anything in this video that didn't didn't go over or cover something that you need to know it's a fairly new phone so there's not not a total listen. apply a little bit of pressure all over the screen but not enough to you know damage it we don't want to crack it again right. Make sure everything is is connected and seated properly before we close it back up there's a little a little shaft right here this little thing I'm pointing at that can actually fall out. \"I'm going to try to make it where you can see what's going on my fingers are just too too fat and too big to fit down in there properly and be able to to get that so we're going to use the spudger\" really do a test phone call but it'll be alright you can do a more thorough test when you're doing this repair you can if you want go through practically every function but for the video we're just doing a few quick checks.",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 - How to Take Apart &amp; Replace LCD Glass Screen Replacement",
      "transcript": "hello everyone I'm going to be showing you how to replace the entire LCD and glass screen assembly on your Samsung Galaxy s8 alright so first thing you're going to want to do guys is make sure that the phone is powered off once the phone is completely powered off what we're going to do is we're going to need to give it some heat on the back cover okay we're going to need to either give it heat with a hairdryer all around with a heat gun be very careful with the heat gun because it can overheat the phone or you can also sit it on a hot plate which is what I have and you also have to be careful if you're going to use a hot plate because the temperature can get very hot and it could burn the phone as well all right so I'm going to give it some heat give it enough heat to where when where you can touch it but it will burn slightly that's when you know you're ready that we can begin to lift up on the back right so I'm going to heat it up now and I'm and then afterwards I'm going to show you how to begin to remove the back cover so let's give it some heat first all right so I've put it up to heat for a minute or two pretty hot now alright so we're going to do is we're going to get a suction cup we're going to place it here on the lower on the bottom side of the phone from the bottom rear side we're going to place the suction cup as close to the tip as possible alright and then what we're going to do is we're going to lift up on it we're going to lift up on it gently not too fast not too rough because we don't want to break the glass so lift up on it gently until you just see an opening thank you I see an opening right there there you go as soon as you start seeing an opening we're going to need to we're going to need to remove we're going to need to stick a prying tool in there all right so all right looks like there's an opening right there right there stick the prying tool right there once you have the prank go in there all right we good to go you can leave the suction cup on there but we're going to need to do now is we're going to need to go around the phone very gently with the prying tool just go around the back around the entire phone all right if you if you can if you have to I'm two ticks or playing cards I would suggest to use two that way you can um go around the phone with both of them take this voila oh the phone is still pretty hot all right so we're going to continue to go around yeah all right so once you have most of it looks like the phone turned on it's powered off alright once you have most of the back peeled off towards the top you can lift it up gently and it will open up completely alright and then we're going to remove the rest of the back cover which will be held down with a little bit more adhesive all right so next thing we're going to do is we're going to be removing all of these screws these are going to be Phillips head screws that are on the back frame of the phone so we're going to be using a small Phillips head screwdriver alright let's go ahead and do that now yeah okay so once you have all of the Phillips head screws removed we can go ahead and begin to lift up the back pieces here on the back of the housing all right so you can either do it with your finger or you can do it with a prying tool all right so I'm going to lift up here first gently this is the wireless this is the wireless charger pad all right so let's lift up on this and then we can go ahead and lift up on this side right here alright so this whole piece comes out to put that to the side all right and then now we can go ahead and remove the bottom portion over here which is where the ear speaker is all right let's put that to the side next thing we're going to want to do is we're going to go ahead and disconnect the battery cable to make sure that the phone doesn't turn on and there's no electricity flowing through the phone all right this is the inside of the new Samsung Galaxy s8 all right charging port down here this is the LCD cable right this is the front the selfie camera there's another flex cable over here let's disconnect this all right so next we're going to have to go ahead and disconnect this small flex cable down here it should be for the home button this is going to be for the antenna we're going to disconnect these two antennas right here in this one right here right so once you have all of these cables connected the last thing we're going to need to remove before we go ahead and all right and then one more thing we're going to have to remove before we go and take it further apart is we're going to have to remove the SIM card tray so let's go up here with the sim ejector pin and let's remove that put that to the side okay once you have all the antennas and flex cables disconnected the SIM card tray removed we can go ahead and lift up on the motherboard over here on the side and it will lift right out pretty simple guys like Dupre the previous models place that to the side alright so here what we're going to do is if you want to remove the battery we're going to give this give the screen some more heat with either heating up with either a hairdryer heat gun or we can place it on a hot plate again alright so it's hot enough again to the touch where you can't touch it for too long and then we're going to begin to pry up on the battery alright so I'm going to do that now I'm going to give it some heat and I'll continue to recording once it's hot enough all right so once you feel it's hot enough again we're going to go ahead and get the phone we're going to get a prying tool once again I'm going to be using this pin metal prying tool you can use a plot you can use a different prying tool as well but what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to squeeze it in between here between the battery and the frame you see the slide opening right here and we're going to press down on it and we're going to lift up on it on the battery alright and we're going to get under there and lift up on the battery alright and the battery will come right out and as you can see that's the adhesive holding the battery down alright so next step we're going to need to next thing we're going to need to do is we are going to need to we're going to need to all right so next thing we're going to need to remove is we're going to need to remove the ear speaker alright so we're going to wedge under here with this thin tool and we're going to lift up on the ear speaker alright and the ear speaker will come right out place that to the side all right the front the front or selfie camera has a bracket holding it down so we're going to need to remove this bracket no we're not alright next thing we're going to need to remove is the front camera or selfie camera we're going to pry up on it all right and then we're going to lift up pull it back and it comes right out just place that here as well alright next thing we're going to need to remove is the vibrator motor alright so for the vibrator motor we're going to need a we're going to need a a very thin prying tool all right and then pull up on it all right and it comes right out put that to the side all right next thing we're going to have to remove is we're gonna have to remove this right here you're going to wedge under with the prying tool pull back on it all right and I believe this is the proximity sensor for the camera so let's put that over here all right next thing we're going to need to do is we're going to remove the charging port so we're going to remove all the Philips head screws that are holding down the charging port first all right so once all the Phillips head screws are removed next thing we're going to need to do is disconnect this small flex cable right here which is for the headphone jack so let's go ahead and disconnect that all right then what we're going to do is we're going to pry up on the headphone jack so we're going to wedge under it with a screwdriver and lift up on it and it will come right out let's pull it out alright so the next step is we're going to be lifting up the charging port all right so we're going to get under the cable right here and wedge up on it alright there's also the small cable here on the side which we're going to have to lift up as well be careful you don't break it as it is very thin all right so we're going to gently pull up on the entire charging port section alright so the entire charging port comes out alright so let's move to remove that all right so once you have the phone like this the only thing left that we would need to remove is the power button and the volume and bigsby button over here on the other side alright but once you order your screen you should order it like this with the frame as well it will come together as one piece the glass LCD and the frame so once you have like this all we would have to do is put everything back in reverse order alright so let's go ahead and do that now yeah I ah Oh all right so once you have our the back pieces of the housing back in everything is back in place all right we're going to go ahead and place all the small Phillips head screws back on you all right so next thing we're going to need to do is make sure you connect this small flex cable here which is for the heart rate sensor let's go ahead and connect it right here you might have to play around with it a little bit to connect it it is a little bit annoying but it's not that hard alright so looks like I got it connected there's not too much light in there yeah so once you have it connected you can go ahead and place the back cover back on place it as position it as perfectly as you can on the back all right and once it's positioned correctly go ahead and give it some pressure so that it will close up tightly all right and then once you're ready place your sim card tray back in all right and we are all set all right guys so that is how you replace the LCD screen and glass screen assembly on your Samsung Galaxy s8 I hope this video was helpful to you if it was please give it a like and subscribe for more videos like this until next time

      "title": "LG G6 Disassembly Teardown - A Quick Look Inside!",
      "transcript": "hi guys that's 100 all calm where we get onion or every day anyway today we're going to go ahead and learn how to disassemble the LG G 6 let's go do this baby alright before we begin you'll need some couple guitar picks um you can get a plastic screwdriver from Jerry Rick everything right or you can get some plastic 9 right and also a number zero zero screwdriver and of course you will need a heat gun you will also need a suction cup this is a five dollar suction cup for car mount and you can also use as a Carmel I'll blink on where you buy this first you'll want to use the heat gun to heat up the back of the phone then put these suction cups towards the bottom of the phone apply some more heat gun to the bottom of the phone are you also need a very sharp knife to get between the glass I'm just using a box knife go ahead and heat up the bottom of the phone then stick your sharp knife between the god of the dark cloth and the phone next take a guitar pick and slowly moves up the side apply some more heat using the heat gun and repeat the process until the Holbach loss comes off boom Shakalaka baby as you can see here this is the back cover this is made from gorilla glass slide yeah your fingerprint sensor there in contact to the mainboard also note the waterproofing is actually done through all this tape alright once you disassemble it you're probably going to lose waterproofing unless you actually replace those pieces perfectly right I may have another video on that but for right now I'm just going to go ahead and disassembly also don't forget to take the SIM card tray out alright next you're going to go ahead and take all these screws out one two three four five six seven eight nine ten there's actually hidden one right here so make sure to take this out also there's 11 through right slowly pull the wireless charging unit which is dustless adhesive carefully pull the top part of the plastic assembly out if it gets stuck try wiggling the bottom right of it and it should fall out after that the bottom speaker assembly should also easily pop out the battery is stuck with adhesive to get it out first disconnect the battery connector heat it with heat gun then pry out with any flat plastic tool I once that L it is pretty easy to do simply undo the front camera connector at the top and also the LCD and additional connector so one two three and pop them out once those three connectors are disconnected the motherboard will easily slip out by the coolest part about LG g6 is that it actually has a little heatsink that comes out here and I believe this is actually attached to the frame so the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 one does not get super hot now there is a thermal paste so when you put it back you'll have to put new thermal paste and you can see that's where the CPU is right there alright guys if you guys want to replace the screen because you cracked it I would not try to just replace the screen because the LCD is attached by adhesive if you just replace the screen itself you're going to probably lose your waterproofing all right usually with most phones you can buy the assembly along with the LCD digitizer all right like places like Aliexpress I would buy that and you may have to replace the USB here just take it out and put it in a new one you'll probably have to just go ahead and pull the front camera out and put it on the new one also but otherwise you should be able to get a full assembly for like 50 bucks more that's my recommendation now my friend Jerry rig everything has a video where he actually takes the LCD out it's actually pretty easy to do again I would not do that because you're going to totally lose your waterproofing just because how sensitive these phones are okay so this is the main camera now that has a F so that's how the OS works the lens moves up to counterbalance your shakes all right whereas the wide-angle does not have to is obviously it's a wide-angle you really don't need a YX good supply angle but if you break these you can simply pop them out and replace it it's really easy to do to reassemble first you'll want to clean up these thermal paste and apply new thermal paste go ahead and clean off all the existing somos pastes you need some soju or your favorite bottle to clean it for thermal paste you can use PC thermal paste like optics silver simply put a simple drop of it carefully put the motherboard back on next connect the front camera connector then connect the two connectors at the bottom and the US models do have wireless charging this is a wireless charging unit which is kind of cool but you do lose the hi-fi audio that the Koreans get next let's the battery back in and also connect the battery connector carefully place the top plastic assembly back on first it should all stop into place easily then put the bottom speaker assembly back on they should all snap into place lastly but not least go ahead and screw all the screws back in that is 11 screws total now if you obsolete need water think you'll want to replace the adhesives with new ones and make sure to apply them perfectly but now I'm just going to

The battery is stuck with adhesive to get it out first disconnect the battery connector heat it with heat gun then pry out with any flat plastic tool. The coolest part about LG g6 is that it actually has a little heatsink that comes out here and I believe this is actually attached to the frame. waterproofing all right usually with most phones you can buy the assembly along with the LCD digitizer all right like places like Aliexpress I would buy that and you may have to replace the USB here just take it out and put it in a new one. to reassemble first you'll want to clean up these thermal paste and apply new thermal paste go ahead and clean off all the existing somos pastes you need some soju or your favorite bottle to clean it for thermal paste you can use PC thermal paste like optics silver simply put a simple drop of it carefully. perfectly but now I'm just going to reuse the adhesive carefully put the back cover back on apply some heat gun and keep pressing down on the back Cover until it is flush power on your phone if it powers up Congrats once turned on check and make sure everything is working such as 4G LTE front camera back camera etc etc now you guys like horses anyway that's how you disassemble and reassemble your LG g6.",

With the motherboard released we're able to disconnect the 12.3 megapixel rear- facing camera that has Nifty features such as phase and Laser detection autofocus. our thoughts towards repairability how did the pixel XL score it got a 6 out of 10 and here's why. Many components are modular and can be easily replaced once the display assembly is removed the battery has a removal Tab and is adhered by a modest amount of adhesive making its removal painless. All the screws are T5 torque screws and the opening procedure requires prying up a very thin and poorly supported display assembly.",

      "transcript": "hello everyone this is matt from real world review and today we're gonna change the battery on the pixel XL just to note this will also apply to the 5-inch pixel as well so the tools that we will need will be a t5 bit a razor blade a pic of some sort something bigger for prying the battery like this plastic card some glue or adhesive and some heat you will also need some clamps for the drying process so the first thing we want to do is remove the screen feel free to check out my screen replacement video for a more detailed explanation of how to remove this screen but for those who have the screen removed let's speed this up once the screen is lifted off the phone we can use the t5 bit to remove these two screws along with this metal panel and unplug the screen next we want to remove the two screws at the top the one screw on the side these two screws near at the bottom and then the four at the very bottom once the screws are removed we want to lift up this plastic area of this metal panel and try and get a pic in there so we can lift it off the phone this may be a little bit difficult so you may have to try some other areas just make sure to be careful around the battery area which is on the bottom portion once the mid frame is removed we can unplug the battery as well as a charging port cable you can either remove this cable or put it to the side like I did next once you've worn or to is get a pry tool and start at the top the pic did not work for me so I went to the credit-card style once you start cutting through the adhesive you want to lift up the battery just a little bit and then go on the edges like shown once one side lifts up then you can lift up the other side with some force and you should be good just make sure you're not bending the battery next what you want to do is replace the adhesive strips right here in this situation I didn't need to replace it so I'm just gonna leave it how it came then what we want to do is plug in the battery and set the battery down once everything is set unplug the battery to make sure that no power goes through the phone and plug in the charging port cable on the bottom as well as on the top once that's in we can plug in the battery and then we'll plug in the screen to make sure that the battery works for this situation the phone ended up being the issue not the battery so I did put the old battery in there next what you want to do is clean up this metal frame getting rid of all the adhesive on it it's a lot easier to do rather than being in the phone well if it's in the phone it's still easy to do but you do risk scratching up the metal piece around the edges if you're not careful once the adhesive is removed you can set the metal panel back in place and then put in all the screws except for the two that hold down the screen if you're having trouble putting the metal panel back in make sure that the antenna cables on the right and left side are lined up perfectly or else it may lift on those areas once the panel is in you can clean up the screen getting rid of all the adhesive or most of it be very careful on this area because you do not want to break that OLED screen once most or all the adhesive is removed you can plug the screen back into the phone put the metal panel back on and put the two screws back in next what you want to do is test the screen but in this situation the phone doesn't work so we'll move on next we want to apply the adhesive or glue I recommend using glue and this is how I recommend applying it feel free to do it a way that you're used to but make sure that you get around all the edges and once you get towards the top make sure to be careful around the front camera and the earpiece areas you once all the glue or adhesive is in place you can set down the screen and add pressure since I'm using glue I'm gonna use clamps for the curing process once you let the glue sit for about 30 minutes to an hour you can clean off the glue and then you're all set hopefully this video helped you out if you have any questions leave them in the comment section or on twitter i'm matt of rwr and feel free to follow me on the social media listed above also subscribe to my channel so you can see more videos like this as well as review videos and hit that Bell button so then YouTube actually reminds you when those videos do come out thanks for watching",

Once the mid frame is removed we can unplug the battery as well as a charging port cable. The phone ended up being the issue not the battery so I did put the old battery in there next what you want to do is clean up this metal frame getting rid of all the adhesive on it. Once the adhesive is removed you can set the metal panel back in place and then put in all the screws except for the two that hold down the screen. the adhesive or most of it be very careful on this area because you do not want to break that OLED screen once most or all the adhesive is removed you can plug the screen back into the phone.

      "title": "Repairing A Google Pixel 7 Pro Using Googles Self Repair Program",
      "transcript": "this pixel 7 Pro looks as broken as I sound sick but unlike my cold it won't be going away by itself it's going to need a little operation to get back on its feet it hasn't taken someone long to damage their Google pixel 7 and instead of repairing it they've chosen to sell it on besides the damage to the screen the remainder of the device is in great condition I purchased this phone online in its current condition for 400 Australian dollars or around 265 us that's 900 cheaper than a new one on the Australian Google Store a bargain I think so with a broken pixel in my hands there's no better time to try out Google's self-repair program they've partnered with iFixit to sell parts for the pixel 2 and newer that's six generations of devices almost every single Google pixel phone ever released compared to other companies self-repair programs Google certainly offers the most amount of Parts the new display and adhesive for Google's latest phone sent me back 362 dollars it's time we begin heating up the front display on a heat plate before we begin working on lifting up the display I've completed a tear down and repair assessment for the Google pixel 7 however not the 7 Pro despite this I'm assuming the internals and opening procedure will be almost identical the big difference is this phone screen is badly shattered meaning a suction cup won't be able to help us lift it up but also the screen has lost its rigidity so it will fall apart as we remove it as we begin to lift up the display we can see that it is separated into three parts but as we're replacing it it doesn't matter we'll need to get it disconnected before we can fully remove it its Flex cable is located under this metal bracket on the pixel 6 there's a screw holding it in but on the seven it's a stubborn clip a backwards move that could result in someone puncturing the battery trying to remove it I managed to deform mine but it was easy enough to bend back into place with the cable free it's time to pull off the remainder of the display well there's no fooling anyone into believing this screen still works before attaching the new display I'll first need to remove all the old adhesive left behind by the old screen when I did this to a pixel 7 it put up a fight but I'm having no issue on this pixel 7 Pro I guess this process could go either way but I did get tricked by a black piece up the top it's not adhesive just part of the housing with that all the old remnants of the destroyed screen are gone and thanks to this phone's construction we don't have to dive any further inside to complete the screen replacement in fact this whole procedure is a pretty straightforward repair when compared to most other Flagship phones it's now time to unbox our new parts I was kind of expecting them to sharpen some special Google boxes or something but they've just been packaged up like normal iFixit Parts which of course is totally fine but I was a little concerned with receiving the display in just a padded envelope because shipping companies aren't always the nicest when it comes to protecting your parcels this display is looking fantastic it's great to be able to Source genuine parts and as of making this video the difference between this genuine screen and one for sale elsewhere is usually only the matter of 10 to 20 difference and some of those aftermarket screens require you to somehow transfer the fingerprint reader it's not at all worth the hassle for a 20 saving so I can totally see people utilizing Google's genuine parts by using the genuine adhesive to secure it all down it should also be just as water and dust resistant as before there's a bit of tape to remove before we can go ahead and attach the display onto the phone as the connector is recessed beneath the heatsink it makes it a bit hard to connect once it's attached it's time for a test there's a big sticker saying I need to remove the screen protector and not touch the screen while powering up the phone as it will do some Auto calibration I'm not quite sure what Auto calibration it completed because like usual the fingerprint reader doesn't work with the new screen I'll need to recalibrate it later using my computer we'll shut down the Google pixel 7 Pro and continue with the reassembly there is plenty of plastic protective film to come off the two upper pieces on the display were really stuck on if you're doing this yourself I'd recommend taking them off prior to attaching the display's flex cable there's also a hidden plastic film over the camera lens miss that and you won't have a selfie camera with all the plastic film removed I can attach the display's retaining bracket and close up the display firmly pressing it into place the last thing left to do is recalibrate the fingerprint reader for this I'll attach the phone to a computer and place the phone into fastboot mode using Google Chrome and Google's pixel repair site I can run the calibration once complete it will reboot and you'll find it still doesn't work that's because you need to restart the phone one more time then the fingerprint function will work on the new display this process has been the case from the pixel 6 and onwards while this means you need to do an extra step after repair it doesn't prohibit you from replacing your pixel's display and with that we're done so this is it a repaired Google pixel 7 Pro costs totaling 762 Aussie dollars or around 500 us this was a really quick and easy repair with all calibration tools being accessible online no need to call up a special call center OR technician to initiate the calibration like we experienced with Apple's self-repair program it's always great to see another company selling genuine parts to Consumers and on that note this has been a Hugh Jeffries video if you like what you saw consider subscribing and check out the phone restoration playlist for more videos just like this one and if you're looking for any used devices be sure to check out my online store linked which is down the description that's all for this video and I'll catch you guys next time",

upload a new video and if you need any tools there are links in the description so to start off the sim tray needs to be removed here's a better look at that now he needs to be applied to the screen to loosen up the adhesive underneath and then the pry tool can be used to pry the screen off foreign once the screen has been pried off it can be lifted over from the right to the left but be careful since the flex cable is still attached to the main board at this point the metal cover covering the connector for the string cable needs to be removed now the screen cable can be disconnected from the main board looking at the back of the screen we can see the plastic framework border which has some catches on it which clip into place on the housing or frame of the phone in addition to the adhesive behind the screen to ensure a better seal there's also copper tape behind the screen to help transfer heat a cutout over here for the proximity sensor the slot where the front-facing camera sits into as well as the fingerprint reader which is adhered to the back of the screen now the graphite film needs to be peeled off and the graphite film helps to transfer heat foreign at this point there are 14 T4 or Torx 4 screws which need to be removed here's a look at the aluminum mid plate there's a liquid damage indicator sticker which is that white sticker on the bottom looking at the other side we can see a thermal pad over here which sits on top of the processor to help transfer heat there's also a graphite pad over here as well as the linear haptic feedback or vibrator motor on the bottom the battery cable cannot be disconnected from the main board there's also a pull tab provided to help you pry the battery off foreign tab you're supposed to slide it up and pull it from the left to right back and forth I'll try prying off the adhesive however after attempting that it wasn't really working for me and I accidentally pulled the tab out so I'm just going to apply some isopropyl alcohol around the sides of the battery and let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute so it needs to have the adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off thank you foreign here's a better look at the 4575 milliamp hour battery here's a better look at the 10.5 megapixel front facing camera here's a better look at the 50 megapixel primary and the 12 megapixel Ultra wide camera the primary camera is the only one with ois or Optical image stabilization this bracket is a placeholder for where the 5G millimeter wave antenna would go on the top and just because this phone doesn't have a 5G millimeter wave antenna it doesn't mean it doesn't support 5G it just doesn't have the 5G millimeter wave technology which some networks use here's the bottom speaker assembly and there's a mesh filter of the speaker opening to remove the main board there are two more T4 or torx4 screws which need to be removed so taking a look at the main board we can see the charger port is still soldered to the main board as always which makes replacing the charger port more difficult there's also a rubber gasket around the charger port itself the primary microphone is located next to it we can also see the Sim reader located here as well as the proximity and ambient light sensor on top we can also see copper tape or the front Shield once that's peeled back we can see a thermal pad on top of this chip once the thermopad has been removed we have a better look at the ram which is Seated on top of the processor looking at the other side we can see the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi module and some more graphite film on the shield there's a single T4 or torx4 screw holding down the top of your speaker assembly here's a better look at that and there's a rubber gasket around the opening of the speaker moving on there are two additional microphones on top one by the rim of the frame and one on the back camera bezel assembly both are connected to this Flex cable which also connects the LED flash and the backlight sensor to the main board the flex cable reviews for the NFC antenna and wireless charging coil and there's some more graphite film to help transfer heat and this flexible over here so the power button and volume keys on the side to replace that you'd have to gently peel off this Flex cable and then lift up on those metal tabs to pull them out of the frame the glass camera lens cover can be replaced by applying heat and gently prying it off so you won't need to take apart the phone to replace this glass cover as for the panels on the back those are glued to the frame with very strong adhesive so prying those off will be very difficult if possible at all without damaging them for the repairability score on this phone I give it a 7 out of 10. now it's time to put the phone back together once everything's back in place power on the phone and you're done thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one",

There are 14 T4 or Torx 4 screws which need to be removed. attempting that it wasn't really working for me and I accidentally pulled the tab out so I'm just going to apply some isopropyl alcohol around the sides of the battery and let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute so it needs to have the adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off. need to be removed so taking a look at the main board we can see the charger port is still soldered to the mainBoard as always. There's also a rubber gasket around the chargerPort itself. The primary microphone is located next to it we can also see the Sim reader located here as well as the proximity and ambient light sensor. both are connected to this Flex cable which also connects the LED flash and the backlight sensor to the main board the flex cable reviews for the NFC antenna and wireless charging coil. There's some more graphite film to help transfer heat and this flexible over here so the power button and volume keys on the side to replace that you'd have to gently peel off thisflex cable and then lift up on those metal tabs to pull them out of the frame the glass camera lens cover can be replaced by applying heat and gently prying it off.",

      "transcript": "this is the google pixel 6a disassembly if you're interested in seeing more videos like this make sure you subscribe and follow me on twitter so you'll be notified when i upload a new video and if you need any tools there are links in the description now before i start the video i just want to say one thing i have no idea if this is an isolated incident or what but this pixel 6a was a brand new unit and i opened the seals on the box myself however when i took a closer look at the back both the camera lens bezel and the back plate are scratched up both have scratches or scuffs on them and there's some dust or debris inside the box so i'm not sure if this would be the case for anyone else here's a closer look and i'm not sure how well the camera will pick up the scuffs or scratches let me know in the comments below if your unit has this type of issue the screen however doesn't have any scratches since it has this protector over it that comes in the box all right let's move on with the disassembly first the sim tray needs to be removed here's a better look at that next we need to apply heat to the front of the phone to loosen up the adhesive underneath the screen and then we're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off now be careful when you're getting your plastic pry tool and you don't damage the screen underneath once the screen is loose from the frame you need to lift it from the right side to the left but be careful since the screen cable is still attached there's a metal cover over the connector that needs to be removed now the screen cable can be disconnected from the main board here's a better look at the screen the plastic housing for the front-facing camera is located on top and there's a plastic frame around the screen this plastic frame also has catches around the sides which in addition to the adhesive around the screen help hold the screen to the frame even though the flex cable for the fingerprint sensor can be disconnected from the screen the sensor itself is adhered or glued to the screen so i'm assuming screen replacements will come with this fingerprint sensor pre-attached the protective film on the bottom by the charger port needs to be peeled off there are 16 t4 or torx four screws which need to be removed the screw sizes are different so make sure to remember where each screw goes now the mid plate can be lifted up and removed there's a large piece of graphite foam over the front of the midplate and the graphite film helps transfer heat the vibrator motor is located on the bottom corner now that we have access to the battery cable we're going to disconnect that first now the provided plastic pull tab can be used to help pry the battery off prying this battery off was much easier compared to the pixel 6 or pixel 6 pro now let's peel off this piece and then we have a better look at the battery which has a minimum rating of 4 306 milliamp hours and the typical rating of 4 410 milliamp hours the bottom speaker assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that and there's a mesh filter over the opening there's a single t4 screw which is holding on the main board that needs to be removed and then the main board can be lifted up and removed taking a closer look at the main board the charger port is soldered onto the main board so making a charger per replacement will be difficult the primary microphone is located right next to it the sim reader is located here there's copper tape on these shields also some thermal paste over this one the proximity sensor is located on top as well as the connectors for the two back cameras and those connectors can be disconnected by just popping them off here's a better look with the removable shields removed there's some thermal gel on these chips and the processor here's a better look at the ram and processor and the raw more storage taking a look at the other side we have a better look at the 12 megapixel ultra wide lens the 12.2 megapixel primary lens and the connector for the 8 megapixel front-facing camera the main camera is the only camera with ois or optical image stabilization and more copper tape on the back shields and there's a red rubber gasket around the charger port once the removable shield on the bottom is removed and the copper tape is peeled off the shields we can see more thermal gel on these chips on the frame itself there's more copper tape which sits underneath the motherboard and there looks to be a cutout on the frame for wireless charging but there's no wireless charging coil there's only the flex cable which leads to an nfc antenna located in the center here's a better look with the graphite film and copper tape peeled off there's your nfc antenna the back plate on the pixel 6a is removable you just have to apply some heat and pry it off you also need to make sure to completely peel off this nfc antenna flex cable or peel off and remove the flex cable from the frame over here so you don't tear it if you're prying off your back plate here's a better look at the plastic backplate and here's the frame itself the top panel and the camera lens convert can both be heated up and pry it off as well the top speaker is held on with some adhesive including the flex cable for it so we need to gently pry that off here's a better look at that it has a red rubber gasket around the opening and there are two locations with the small white foam balls and finally there's a secondary microphone located on top which is attached to the flex cable for the led flash for the repairability score i give this phone a 7 out of 10. now it's time to put the phone back together once everything is back in place reapply the screen power on the phone and you're done i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll see you in the next one",

videos if you need any tools there are links in the description first the sentry needs to be removed next we need to heat up the front of the phone where the screen is so we can loosen up the adhesive underneath and then we'll need to use some sort of a suction cup tool to help us gain leverage between the screen and the frame of the phone so we can place our plastic pry tool in between and run it along the edges to pry the screen off once the screen's free from the frame lift it up from the right to the left but be careful since the cable for the screen is still attached to the main board there's a metal bracket here covering the connector for the screen which needs to be lifted up and removed and there's a latch on the side so we're going to bypass that by pulling away from the frame now the screen cable can be disconnected the in-screen fingerprint reader is located here and it is adhered to the screen so if you needed to replace this you would have to disconnect the cable over here by lifting up the latch and pulling that cable out and then you have to heat up this area and pry this portion off now i'm not sure if replacement screens will come with this fingerprint reader pre installed but i would hope so since replacing this part might be a little bit difficult since you'll have to read here this part back to the screen there's also a cutout on the top portion of the screen for the proximity sensor here's a better look at that cutout there are also five clips on the plastic border which is attached to the screen and those clips help hold the screen down more securely aside from those clips the adhesive around the screen is pretty strong so prying the screen off was really difficult and took a lot of time to make sure not to damage it there's graphene film here here and here and the graphing film help transfer heat once the graphene film is peeled off there are 9 t4 or torx 4 screws which need to be removed now the mid plate can be removed here's a better look at the mid plate the haptic feedback or linear vibrator motor is located on the back of the midplate next before we continue the battery cable needs to be disconnected the camera cables can be disconnected are two t4 screws holding on the camera assembly which need to be removed now the camera assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that so to remove the battery there's a pull tab provided to help us pry the battery off that didn't really work so this pull tab easily slides out so we're gonna have to actually use some isopropyl alcohol and get some around the edges of the battery and let it sit there for about 30 seconds to a minute so it eats away with adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off here's a better look at the battery there's one more flex cable we need to disconnect and then there are five t4 screws we need to remove on the bottom speaker assembly now the speaker assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that and there's a mesh filter over the speaker opening at this point there is one more t4 screw on the top of the board which needs to be removed once that's removed we can lift up and remove the main board taking a better look at the main board the proximity sensor is located on top there's some graphene film over the shields the sim card reader is located here and the charger port is located on the bottom with a rubber gasket around it now one thing i don't like about this design is the charger port is soldered onto the board so if that were to get damaged it would be difficult to replace and next to that is a primary microphone once the graphene film is peeled back we can see a thermal pad on top of the processor here's a look at the back side of the board there's a single t4 screw holding down the top earpiece speaker once the screw is removed we can lift up and remove the earpiece speaker here's a better look at that there's a rubber gasket around the opening the led flashboard is located underneath and this flex cable connects that flashboard to the main board there's also a secondary microphone on this board and the third microphone on top which is connected by this flex cable on the top right side there's a placeholder for where the millimeter wave antenna would go and there's one t4 screw holding down that placeholder once the graphene film on the back is peeled back it reveals where the wireless charging coil is as well as the nfc antenna there's a square cutout in the metal frame over here and the connector is over here this flex cable also connects the volume keys and power button to the main board so if you want to replace those you just have to pull up on this metal bracket and remove that and then you'll be able to push in the keys and remove them now the glass camera lens cover as well as the glass pieces on the back are held down with adhesive so if you wanted to replace those or remove those you would have to heat them up and pry them off as far as repairability goes i give this phone a 6 out of 10. there is strong adhesive holding the screen down but aside from that screen replacement shouldn't be too difficult however there is more work to take apart the rest of the phone and the fact that the charger port soldered onto the main board that would make charge upper replacements difficult now it's time to put the phone back together once everything's back in place reapply your screen and then power on the phone and you're done i hope you enjoyed the video and i'll see you in the next video",

      "transcript": "So what’s inside the world’s thinnest\npremium smartphone? If you drop your phone and it cracks the glass,\nhow hard it is to replace the screen? Let’s find out. First off I’m going to remove the SIM card\ntray since there are no visible screws on the outside of the device. Then I’m going to use a heat gun to melt\noff the adhesive underneath the back glass panels. It turns out that the construction of this\nphone is kind of weird. Technically you can remove the screen without\npopping off these glass panels but I’m going to show it anyway and then you can decide\nwhich method is best for you. I found that the easiest way to get underneath\nthe back glass panel was to start at the plastic portion of the frame and dip my metal pry\ntool underneath the glass and gently slide it out. Once the metal pry tool is in I’m going\nto reheat the back glass to make sure that the adhesive is good and soft so I’m not\ncracking anything. Once the back glass panel flips up I can just\ntear it off and set it off to the side and repeat the process for the top panel. When you’re heating it up you want to get\nit just too hot to touch, then you know the adhesive is getting soft underneath. Now that both panels are off I can remove\nthis gold bar on the bottom section of the phone. This bar is purely aesthetics; there is no\nactual value to it. It’s just there for looks. Now the reason for taking off the back panel\nis so you can push up gently on the screen from the back side now and you don’t have\nto be sticking things deep inside of the phone, like playing cards. It gives you a little bit more leverage and\nroom to work with. Either way there is still adhesive all the\nway around the edge of the screen so I’m going to warm it up just like we did with\nthe back glass, and then slide my metal pry tools around the black side of the glass,\nmaking sure that my tools do not touch the screen where the display is because metals\nand displays do not go well together. It will crack very easily. You’ll see how thin this screen is in a\nsecond. Once I have all of the adhesive cut away from\nthe sides, the top and the bottom, we can see how the screen is connected. Definitely go slow during this part and reheat\nthe screen as often as needed, getting the glass just too hot to touch. The part that you have to be careful with\nis down here at the bottom of the phone. That’s where the ribbon cable is for the\ndisplay. Now if your screen is already broken, obviously\nyou don’t need to be as careful as I am, but I’m going to reuse my screen so I’m\ntaking special care not to damage it. Now this screen has the same Lego-like connections\nthat we see on most every other phone except Samsungs and iPhones. So we’re going to remove the protective\nmetal covering and unsnap the screen like a little Lego from the motherboard. Make sure you stay organized with all your\nlittle parts. There are a couple more components inside\nthat we’ll be taking out so make sure they don’t all get mixed up. So here is the glass screen. It’s got the glass and the display panel\nfused together as one. And this is what your replacement part will\nlook like when you purchase it. Although it will probably have new adhesive\nsurrounding the top, the bottom and the sides of the glass. I will link replacement parts and tools in\nthe video description below just like always. Now let’s see what else can be replaced. I’m going to set that metal bracket off\nto the side and then pull off this tape that’s covering the battery and the motherboard. Set this off to the side. You can try to reuse this if you want, but\nit’s pretty flimsy stuff. There are 2 screws holding the front earpiece. They are T4 with this particular bit set. Remove these two screws and then the earpiece\ncan pop up and off of the phone. It has the two little contact points that\nrest on the motherboard so it gets its signal. There’s a random plastic piece right here\nunderneath the side button cable. This is where the power and volume button\nconnect to the motherboard. The battery connection is down here underneath\nthis plastic piece. We’ll slide this out from the bottom and\nthen set it off to the side. And then we will unclip the battery, snapping\nit off just like a little Lego, similar to how the screen was. Now the battery can be lifted out from the\nbottom of the phone. There’s nothing underneath that can really\nbe damaged, just the back metal plate. Just make sure you don’t bend or puncture\nthis battery. Lithium ion batteries can explode as you can\nsee from my Note 7 Battery Explosion video. There are two more screws down at the bottom\nfor a total of 4 screws in this entire phone. Usually there are a lot more. The bottom plastic piece pops up and out,\nand this just kind of sits around the charging port. There is a metal plate over the processor\nand the memory. We’re going to pull that off just so we\ncan see what it looks like. There’s really nothing that can be repaired\nunder here. We can see now though that the charging port\nis not replaceable. It is attached very securely to the motherboard,\nso unless you have micro-soldering skills, you’re just going to have to leave it in\nthe phone. The rear facing camera can be swapped out\npretty easily. Just lift up the little latch and slide it\nout, similar to how all of the other cameras are held into place like Samsung. We can see it has the OIS stabilizing as well. It’s kind of like a little gyro that sits\ninside of the camera unit to stabilize your videos and your pictures. There is one more big screw holding the motherboard\ninto place. And then surprisingly the motherboard does\nnot want to come out from the back of the frame. I assume that it’s secured very permanently\nto the back. I could be a little bit more aggressive with\nit, but the more you bend a motherboard, the more you risk cracking any of the little tiny\nsolder joints that you see around all of those little resisters and processors. And I don’t want to damage this phone permanently\nso we’re just going to leave it in the frame because there’s pretty much nothing here\nthat the common consumer can replace easily without special micro-soldering tools and\nmicroscopes. Let’s put the camera back into place. Tuck it down and clip it in. Reassembling the phone. Put this screw back in as well. The protective plate over the processors and\nthe memory goes back into place and the little tiny plastic bracket down at the bottom near\nthe charging port. Two more screws for that little plastic bracket. And the earpiece goes into place. It will click in. Battery gets tucked down into place and you\ncan plug it in once everything else is plugged in on the board like the little side buttons\nfor the power and volume. I’m going to slip this little plastic bracket\nback into place and this just kind of puts pressure onto that little connection so it\ndoesn’t pop off if you ever drop your phone. I’m going to reconnect the screen. This is where you’ll be using your new screen\nif you’re doing a screen replacement. Just plug it in; you’ll feel it snap underneath\nyour fingers just like a little Lego. And then the little metal bracket goes over\nthe top of it, making sure each little clasp goes inside of the frame so it doesn’t pop\nout ever if you drop your phone. It’s important that this is secure. Remember that your replacement screen will\nprobably have new adhesive so you’ll want to peel off the protective adhesive covering\nso that it will stick to the frame of the phone. I’m going to fold the screen back down into\nplace and set it down, and push it firmly to that the adhesive will reconnect. Remember that bottom decorative metal piece. We’re going to tuck that in and clip it\ndown. And then the back glass pieces can go into\nplace as well, if you decided to use the route that required the removal of the back glass. Top glass gets pushed down into place as well. It fits very securely back here. We can put back in the SIM card tray and we’re\ngood to go. If you have any questions leave them down\nin the comments. Don’t forget to “like” if this video\nhelped you. And remember all of the replacement parts\ncan be found in the video description of this video. All my behind the scenes and future projects\ncan be found on my Twitter and Instagram. I’m definitely looking forward to the iPhone\nrelease this week. The iPhone 7 should be an interesting project. Thanks for watching. Hope to see you around!",

      "summary": "The construction of this phone is kind of weird. Technically you can remove the screen without popping off these glass panels. I found that the easiest way to get underneath the back glass panel was to start at the plastic portion of the frame and dip my metal pry tool underneath the glass. The back panel is so you can push up gently on the screen from the back side. It gives you a little bit more leverage and room to work with. The gold bar on the bottom section of the phone is purely aesthetics. There is no actual value to it. Go slow during this part and reheat the screen as often as needed. The part that you have to be careful with is down here at the bottom of the phone. That’s where the ribbon cable is for the display. This is what your replacement part will look like when you purchase it. Although it will probably have new adhesive surrounding the top, the bottom and the sides of the glass. I will link replacement parts and tools in the video description below just like always. from the bottom and then set it off to the side. And then we will unclip the battery, snapping it off just like a little Lego, similar to how the screen was. Now the battery can be lifted out from the bottom of the phone. There’s nothing underneath that can really be damaged, just the back metal plate. The rear facing camera can be swapped out pretty easily. We can see it has the OIS stabilizing as well. There is one more big screw holding the motherboard into place. And then surprisingly the motherboard does not want to come out from the back of the frame. microscopes. Tuck it down and clip it in.

      "title": "LG G5 Complete Teardown - Screen Replacement - Charging port fix",
      "transcript": "In this video we’re going to analyze the\nbuild quality from inside the LG G5. I will show you how all the components are\nreplaced like the charging port and screen. When I picked up the LG G5 for the first time,\nI just assumed it was plastic by the pure feel and weight of the phone. It felt like plastic. It was not until later, when I checked LG’s\nadvertising and they said it was metal. So let’s see what’s going on. Pop out the battery holster and then there\nare two screws that you can see visibly from inside the phone. And then the rest of this is very similar\nto HTC’s M9. If you’ve ever taken apart that phone, it’s\ngoing to be almost the exact same. The screen is held in by pure friction and\nforce to the inside of this frame. Luckily I have quite a few pry tools to help\nme out along with the process. When I pry between the frame of the screen\nand the frame of the phone, I’m making sure not to put any pressure on the glass or the\nLCD because that’s how it will break. Now if you are replacing your own screen it\ndoesn’t matter as much, but you still don’t want to damage anything inside the phone. So be careful when you’re prying the screen\nout. Now that we’ve lifted away the screen from\nthe metal body we can check to see what this thing is really made of. So I’m taking my razor blade and shaving\naway the back and it’s pure plastic up to this point. There is no metal until you get very deep\ninside the phone and now you can see a glint of silver. This is aluminum down there inside the body. So when you’re touching the phone, you’re\ntouching plastic, a thick layer of plastic. Here on the underside of the phone the inside\nis metal, but you can see along the edges down at the bottom, that is plastic as well. I’m not sure what the thought process here\nwas cuz it definitely doesn’t feel premium and I don’t feel like it should be advertised\nas a pure metal phone. Here’s a spring loaded sensor to tell when\nthe battery is in place. Also a sensor for the fingerprint scanner,\nthe headphone jack, the vibrator and the power button. Those all rest against contacts on the motherboard. There are 6 screws that you need to take out\non the backside; Philips head. Then we’re going to remove the screen ribbon\ncable. It snaps like a little Lego. The front facing camera is 8megapixel. Unsnap that ribbon cable as well as the rear\ncamera. Both of those just unsnap like Legos. The other rear camera, the 16 megapixel, also\nunsnaps from the motherboard. Here you can see the OIS, the image stabilization\ninside of the 8 megapixel rear camera. And this is the 16 megapixel camera with the\nwide angle lens. You can see the GoPro affect it has there\non the glass. Now this is the screen. LG usually sells their screens with the frame\nintact which makes it really easy and their screens are relatively cheap. LG is one of the most cost effective phones\nto repair. So when you’re going to buy the replacement\npart which I will link in the video description, you want to get the one with the frame attached\nto it. It makes the whole repair process a lot easier. You don’t need heat or extra glue or anything\nweird like that. Putting the cameras back into place, snapping\nthem back onto the motherboard. You’ll feel it connect just like a little\nLego right onto the board. Putting the 8 megapixel front camera back\ninto place. There are 6 screws around that back side. Snapping the 8 megapixel rear camera in place\nand the screen ribbon cable onto the main board. I’m going to line up the top and press that\nin. And then be very careful when you’re placing\nyour new screen down into the phone because you can crack it during this process. I’m going to set it in gently and then I’m\ngoing to use my pry tool to put a little pressure against the frame of the screen and the frame\nof the phone to set that down into the little groove where it belongs. Once both sides are flush you can put the\nSIM card tray and SC card tray back in and put those two screws in down at the bottom. Now if your charging port is fine, just put\nthe thing back together again and you’re good to go. I’m going to show you how to replace the\ncharging port though. There are two screws down here at the bottom\nonce the battery is unsnapped from that bottom part. Then it’s kind of the same concept as the\nrest of the phone; you pull away the metal shell housing from the bottom. Once that’s off there’s one more screw. Remove the top plastic housing and then the\ncharging port can just slip out away from the plastic that it’s in. And this is the part that plugs into the wall\nand then that little white part at the top plugs into the phone itself. Pretty straight forward. Putting it all back together again. One last screw. Putting the housing back into place. Get those two screws in at the bottom and\nthen clip the battery back into place and then you can press it into the phone. This phone definitely does not feel premium\nwhether it’s a metal housing covered in plastic or not. It definitely does not feel like metal especially\nwith that thick of a plastic coating.

      "transcript": "hello everyone in this video I'm going to be showing you how to take apart your LG g5 alright so let's get started first thing you're going to want to do is we're going to remove the battery first all right so to remove the battery it's going to have the little button down here on the side you're going to press on it and pull down you do have to press this little button kind of hard so the battery comes out and the bottom part of the phone next thing you're going to want to do is we're going to remove the SIM card and SD card slot which is on the right hand side alright so let's take a pin in there to remove it alright so that comes right out let's put that to the side alright now next thing we're going to need is a small Phillips head screwdriver to remove the two screws on the bottom down here so it's going to have two screws we're going to remove those two screws all right so once those two screws are removed all right so after you have the two bottom screws removed what we're going to have to do with this phone is we're going to have to start prying up in between in between the little line here where you see the frame of the phone housing and the screen there's like a little plastic right here in between so we're going to need to pry it in between there very carefully and gently I'm gonna pry it up up just a little bit here and then a little bit here and here to lift up the screen because it is held down with Clips all right so we're going to work on work on this side first it is recommended that you do it with something plastic so that you do not break the screen all right so I'm going to put something here in the middle you okay so as you can see it is lifting up so I'm going to pry up over here just a little bit more let's place this under here just in the case all right so once you have once you have one of the sides lifted up the other side is a lot easier to lift up all right so once you have it like that it comes right out all right so let's separate the back housing from the front assembly all right so as you can see the more the motherboard is held onto the front assembly with the LCD screen all right so let's put this back housing to the side all right so here we can see all of the other small parts on the phone this this is going to be the LCD cable right here you can unplug that if you need to change that out here's the front camera front camera flex cable you can unplug that as well and the rear camera so I'll plug that all right so to take this phone apart next thing we're going to do is we're going to need to remove a couple more Phillips head screws there's going to be one two three four five and six Phillips head screws that we need to remove okay so once you have those six screws removed and all of the flex cable is disconnected I'm going to remove the front camera because it just came out to put it to the side all right so once you have all the screws removed and all the flex cable is disconnected the motherboard will come right out just lift up lift up on the motherboard slightly because it is held down with some more clips let's remove the flex cable out of the way and the motherboard comes right out let's put that to the side if you need to replace the rear camera you can just lift up on here gently and it will come right up and then up here is the ear speaker alright so if you do need to replace the LCD screen on your g5 or you would have to do is you would have to give it some heat here or put it on a hot plate and then just begin to pry up around the glass here to separate the glass from the housing from the frame all right or I'm sure you could probably also just buy the entire LCD digitizer assembly with a frame league list that we can put back together all right so once you're ready we're going to we're going to put the phone back together now so let's go ahead and put the motherboard back in actually first we're going to when you're ready we're going to go ahead and put the rear camera back in lift the flex cable out of the way and let's place the motherboard back on all right so let's connect the Flex cables let's put the Frank from camera bag on all right and then we're going to have to place the six screws back into place all right so once all of these screws are back on we're going to go ahead and place the back housing back on all right so how we're going to do this is we're going to place the top portion in first and then slowly give it some pressure so that it closes back down all right so we're going to place the top portion back in all right and then let's begin to give it some pressure around the sides all right so then just make sure that everything is back in its place yep all right so now once you're ready we're going to place the two bottom screws back on all right so let's go ahead and place the battery back in and the SD card and the SIM card slot back in all right it's part of the phone on all right so I hope this video helped you out that's how you replace the the LCD or the camera assembly that's how you take apart and teardown the LG g5 I hope this video helped you out I hope you liked it if you did please give it a like

      "title": "Huawei P9 Teardown - Screen Replacement - Battery swap - Charging port fix",
      "transcript": "Today we’re going to be opening up and tearing\ndown the Huawei P9. I’ve done a camera comparison, a durability test, and now it’s time to\nreview the internal build quality. Let’s turn the phone off and remove the SIM card\ntray from the side using your SIM card removal tool. Now before we even open the phone, things\nget interesting. The two screws on the bottom are the exact same size as the iPhone screws.\nThis is the first phone I’ve ever seen with that same size pentalobe screw in it. To remove\nthe frame from the metal body we’re going to use my thin metal pry tool and slip it\nbetween the bottom edge of the phone and screen. But don’t lift it up too far; we have one\nribbon cable that’s attaching the fingerprint scanner to the phone. Unsnap that and then\nthe back housing will come free from the screen. Here’s the back housing. You can see the\nmetal aluminum frame along with the antenna bands that are plastic on the bottom side.\nAnd then here’s another look at that slinky ribbon cable that’s attached to the fingerprint\nscanner. Fairly interesting design. Notice the camera lenses here; we’ll come back\nto those in a second. Here is the motherboard. There are two screws that hold down the battery\nconnection. We’re going to pop off this signal wire and then remove the little metal\nbracket that holds the plugs in place. Unplugging the battery first to disconnect the electricity\nthat’s coursing through the board. That will make it safer overall. Then we’re going\nto disconnect the extension ribbon cable as well as remove the one screw on this other\nside, next to the volume and power ribbons. We’ll disconnect the screen ribbon. And\nthen there are 4 screws holding down the motherboard to the main frame. There are lots of little\nmetal brackets on this phone so make sure you set them right next to the screws so they’ll\nstay organized. So here’s the dual Leica camera set up for the Huawei P9. The cameras\nare mounted in the same metal housing which is good, because if they were separate and\nthe phone was dropped, that would mess up the image combining feature that I talked\nabout in my camera comparison video. That happens with all still images, but not video.\nI still debate on whether that actually works or not, but Huawei says it does, so we’ll\nroll with it. Now Leica, that expensive camera company that Huawei paid to use their name,\ndidn’t actually build this camera. Neither did Huawei. Chinese company called Sunny Optical\nTechnology of China did. But under the direction of Huawei with Leica’s name stamped on it.\nIt all gets very confusing and if you watch my camera comparison video, you’ll understand\nwhy it’s all sketchy, creative wording. The thing that bugs me the most, as a hardware\nguy, is this image that I pulled from Huawei's website. First off we have image covering\ntext…brilliant, but that’s beside the point. Look at all the thick glass in this\nimage. It almost looks like a real professional DSLR camera lens, doesn’t it? But in all\nhonesty, this is straight up false advertising. As you can see from me holding the camera,\nit is nonexistent in the actual phone. And the exterior lens on the back housing is just\na flat piece of glass, just like every other smart phone manufacturer like Samsung and\nthe Apple iPhone. Huawei is straight up lying about the glass in this phone. Anyway, let’s\ncontinue the tear down. We’re going to remove the sticky tape that holds the front camera\nin place. This is an 8 megapixel camera and 720p video. The rear cameras do 1080p video.\nThere is no 4K in this camera. We’ll pop out the motherboard, and while that may look\nlike bubble gum or frosting, it is just thermal paste to transfer the heat from the processors\ninto the metal frame of the phone to cool it down. So don’t eat this. The SIM card\ntray is soldered onto the main board so it’s not removable. There is a dual colored LED\nflash which I really like. When the flash goes off it brings out the color in the picture\nso it’s not washed out since there are two colors flashing at the same time. Now if you\nare going to remove your screen you’ll need to transfer over this proximity sensor, the\nearpiece, and power and volume ribbon buttons to your next screen. I’ll talk about that\nmore in a second. Just keep in mind that there are little components you’ll have to deal\nwith. Now see these black tabs? These things are magical and will make the removing of\nthe battery so much easier. Just grab the top of the tab and pull the adhesive out from\nunderneath the battery, and as the adhesive stretches it loses its stickiness and the\nbattery will pop out relatively easily after both adhesive strips are pulled out. It is\nvery important to pull the adhesive horizontally away from the phone. If you lift up, the adhesive\nwill break and then you’ll be stuck using the old pry away from the metal frame method,\nwhich is a lot harder, so be careful. There is a little bit of adhesive on the bottom\nleft side of the battery that you’ll need to pry out, but it’s a lot softer than the\nactual pull tab adhesive. And be careful with those extension ribbons as you’re prying\nit out. Here’s the battery. I will link replacement parts down in the video description.\nThere are 3 screws holding the charging port components into place. We’re going to unplug\nthe loud speaker first. And then the headphone jack pops off with that metal bracket in place.\nDon’t try to remove the metal bracket from the little ribbon cable that attaches to the\nheadphone jack because it might rip off. We’re going to unplug the extension ribbon cable\nfrom the charging port and disconnect that wire cable. Here is the USB type C charging\nport. It does have a little rubber hat along the bottom. I think this is less for waterproofing\nand more for just shock absorbing. The loud speaker is held very firmly in place. The\nnice thing about all of these components down here is that the metal frame is exactly fit\nto each component so they are very very sturdy inside of that housing. So this is the screen.\nIt has the glass layer, the screen layer underneath that which shows the image and the metal frame.\nLuckily Huawei does sell this component as one; the metal frame, the glass and the screen\nall together. And it’s actually relatively cheap. I will link the replacement parts down\nin the video description. Replacing the screen on this Huawei P9 is actually easier than\nmost Samsung and iPhones. Time to reassemble the phone. We’re going to take the loud\nspeaker and tuck that into place. Set the charging port into place and clip on that\nwire cable and the extension ribbon cable. Once those are secure you can take that little\nmetal plate that’s attached to the headphone jack and snap that into place, as well as\nthe little ribbon cable for the loud speaker. It will snap in like a little Lego. Get the\n3 screws into place and then grab that motherboard and we’ll tack that down into the top. It\ndoes clip in. There’s a little guiding pin down in the bottom left corner to help you\nsituate it correctly. There are arrows as well on the board which is Huawei’s signature\nmove that we’ve seen on all the rest of their phones as well. Clip in the volume and\npower button or your phone will not work. As well as the extension ribbon for the screen\nand for the charging port. Then we’ll get the battery back into place but we’re not\ngoing to plug it in just yet because we don’t want electricity coursing through the board\nwhile we’re working on it. Get the dual Leica camera lens plugged in, as well as the\n8 megapixel front camera. Snap that into place like a little Lego. And now that everything’s\nconnected we can plug in the battery. Just make sure not to turn on the phone yet because\nwe’ll still be screwing things in. The signal wire clips into place. One more camera check.\nThis phone does not have OIS stabilization but it does have the mechanical focus so the\nlens moves just slightly in and out to focus light onto the sensor. Kind of fun. Get those\n3 metal brackets back into place, and the 7 screws that hold that motherboard down.\nThen stick one side of the phone in the back metal housing so you can grab that slinky\nribbon and clip that into place like a little Lego. Once it’s attached you can line up\nthe top edge of the screen with the top edge of the frame. Tuck that into place just like\nwith the iPhone repairs. And then press the sides into place. SIM card slot goes back\nin. And now we can make sure the phone is working. Make sure you get the two bottom\nscrews back into place and you are set. If you have any questions leave them down in\nthe comments. I do respond fairly regularly. Like always, my behind the scenes and Snap\nstory can be found at ZacksJerryRig. I do use Twitter and Instagram quite at bit as\nwell. Thanks a ton for watching. I hope to see you around.",

To remove the frame from the metal body we’re going to use my thin metal pry tool. Unplugging the battery first to disconnect the electricity that’s coursing through the board. There are lots of little metal brackets on this phone so make sure you set them right next to the screws so they’ll stay organized. mess up the image combining feature that I talked about in my camera comparison video. That happens with all still images, but not video. Now Leica, that expensive camera company that Huawei paid to use their name, didn’t actually build this camera. Neither did Huawei. Chinese company called Sunny Optical Technology of China did. camera, it is nonexistent in the actual phone. The exterior lens on the back housing is just a flat piece of glass. The SIM card tray is soldered onto the main board so it’s not removable. need to transfer over this proximity sensor, the earpiece, and power and volume ribbon buttons to your next screen. Now see these black tabs? These things are magical and will make the removing of the battery so much easier. There are 3 screws holding the charging port components into place.

      "title": "Apple iPhone SE 2020 Disassembly Teardown Repair Video Review 99% Identical to iPhone 8!!!",
      "transcript": "you're watching the iPhone se 2020 disassembly so here we have the phone plastic off all right before we begin let's remove the SIM tray next you have two pentalobe screws you need to remove on the bottom once those screws are removed gently heat the front of the phone up a little bit so you can loosen up adhesive underneath the screen and then go ahead and use a plastic pry tool to pry the screen off but be careful the screen cables located on the bottom right hand corner so you don't want to damage out or cut it by accident now you're going to lift your screen up from the left to the right you have seven foot screws you need to remove so you can remove the metal plates covering the connectors once the screws are off we can remove the metal plates now the first thing we wanted this connect is a battery cable next we can disconnect the rest of the cables attach the screen assembly now if you want to remove the battery you have to pull tabs on the bottom you basically pull those tabs off and press the adhesive underneath the battery off you also have two more tabs on top once you pulled all the tabs off you just lift up and remove the battery so comparing the 20/20 iPhone se battery cable to the iPhone 8 battery cable the connector on the battery for the iPhone se is slightly larger than the one from the iPhone 8 so even though they're the same size battery they're not interchangeable so you can see the iPhone se in red and iPhone 8 in black on the left they're both pretty much identical design wise and lick wise all the internal components look the same so we already know the batteries aren't interchangeable let's take a look at the cameras so in order to remove the main camera or the camera which is on the back you have one mounting screw and one Phillips screw holding on the plate that's covering the camera which you need to remove once the screws are removed you can lift up the metal plate cover in the camera remove it and then you'll be able to disconnect the camera cable and then you bit to remove the camera so here's the camera from the 20/20 iPhone se and this is a camera from the iPhone 8 so I got the iPhone 8 camera here and the se over here let's pop in the iPhone 8 camera in the SC and test it out go ahead and reconnect your screen cables once all your screen cables are connected connect your battery cable and then we're going to power on the phone all right cellphones on let's go ahead and open up the camera cameras working fine let's go ahead and flip the camera so you can see the cameras working fine so the screen from the iPhone 8 also works on the iPhone se and a touch ID isn't working since it's from the iPhone 8 and it's not matching the boyfriend iPhone se that's on the screen so pretty much all the parts from the 20/20 iPhone se are the same as the iPhone 8 and are interchangeable so you'll be able to use the iPhone 8 parts for example the cameras charger port speaker the vibrator motor or on the iPhone 8 and on the 20/20 iPhone se the only thing that isn't interchangeable and you can't use from the iPhone 8 on the 20/20 iPhone se is the battery or let's continue to disassembly let's disconnect the rest of the cables two Phillips screws on the top over you have to remove there's one right here and there's one on the inside where the frame is once the screws are removed disconnect this flex cable from the board and then you can remove this piece you have seven screws on top in this area if they remove 6mm are here and one is on the frame on the inside right there if they remove all those what's the screws are removed you can remove these covers you now have one more Philips screw underneath you need to remove and then we're gonna remove this piece that won't cable here we need to disconnect at this point you're left with three stand-up screws to remove the mainboard once your standoffs screws are removed you have one more Philips screw over here in the corner you need to remove so I could remove this bracket right here that's over the mainboard once you remove that flip screw you can lift up and remove this bracket which looks to be holding that antenna cable or something now before you can remove the mainboard you have one more Philips screw hiding underneath this foam padding right here once that screws removed you can finally lift up and remove the mainboard there's a better look at your mainboard you have a graph I film covering both sides next winner will this bracket down here you have one tripod screw over here and two Phillips screws you need to remove and remove this bracket now that one connector here we have to disconnect once you disconnect that connector you have two Phillips screws need to remove one on this corner and one over here now that those screws are removed you can lift up and remove the speaker assembly here's a better location for assembly next we have two Phillips screws here we need to remove so we can remove that plastic bracket we now have six Phillips screws we need to remove on the bottom portion and we have one standoffs right there we need to remove two of the six Phillips screws are on the inside of the frame XL charger for it once you remove your screws you have two microphones which are held on with adhesive make sure you pry them off the frame at this point we can peel off the flex cable for the charger port this is your taptic feedback engine or your vibrator motor right here and it's connected underneath this cable over here so you can disconnect this flex cable by popping it up once you disconnect it it's held on with the adhesive to the bottom of this cable so you'd be able to pry them off and remove them your charger port has a rubber gasket around it so I just point you're left with the frame you have your volume key jewelry here and your vibrator rocker over here the flex cable for that runs over here there's the connector for the board you also connect to your power button switch over here and your flash for your camera now for the screen we've got ten triplane screws six of which are on the sides and you got four on the bottom over here where the fingerprint reader is you also have six Phillips screws on the top portion over here by the speaker on camera let's go ahead and remove these covers now in order to remove this back plate over here there's adhesive over here underneath on one of the cables so you're gonna have to pry that off you can disconnect your fingerprint scanner down here and then there's some adhesive holding down this cable as well so pry it off gently so you don't damage the cable every reader comes out like that no can remove the speaker on top and you're left with your approximately Center on top over here along with your camera over here and you want to remove this you just have to pry off this cable over here same thing that's held on with adhesive so just put a flat tool and wreath it and just pry it off all right now we're going to go ahead and put the foam back together and once everything's back in place power on your phone and you're done hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you guys want to see

screen away from the frame once you get some separation you could put a pry tool or guitar pick anything that works and then work your way around separating the LCD from the frame now when you lift up don't lift up all the way because you have the home button Flex cable that's attached to the main board as you can you can see right here right here so you don't want to tear that no now what you want

the LCD and you can remove the metal plate and now you're going to disconnect the cables from the connectors separating the LCD from the main board so here are the three cables for the LCD one of them goes for the speaker and the proximity sensor the other one's for the touch digitizer which is this this one and this middle one is for the LCD so at this point let's just say if you have a broken screen or crack screen or something's wrong with your screen next thing you're going to have to do is continue on disassembling the screen so there's going there's going to be one two three four screws on the sides you're going to have to remove those once you got those removed next you're going to remove the screws for the ear speaker right here there's two of them and over here there's a

      "transcript": "this is the iphone sc 2022 third generation disassembly if you want to see more videos like this make sure you subscribe and follow me on twitter so you'll be notified when i upload a new video and if you need any tools there are links in the description to start off the sim train needs to be removed next on the bottom of the frame there are two pentalobe screws that need to be removed once those screws are removed we need to apply heat to the front of the screen to loosen some adhesive around the frame and then a suction cup tool needs to be used to help gently lift the screen up and gain leverage so we can get a plastic pry tool in and work our way around prying off the screen the screen is to be lifted up from the left to the right there are seven phillips screws that need to be removed once the screws have been removed the metal plate can be removed as well now the flex cable for the battery can be disconnected once the battery has been disconnected we can proceed to disconnect the rest of the cables in order to remove the battery there are two adhesive pull tabs on the top which have to be pulled to release the adhesive underneath the battery so the battery can be removed there are two more adhesive pull tabs on the bottom of the battery regardless i never seem to have any luck with those pull tabs so i'm going to apply some isopropyl alcohol around the edges of the battery and let it sit for about 30 seconds so easy to have adhesive underneath making it easier to pry it off here's a better look at the 2018 milliamp hour battery now the 2020 second generation iphone se looks almost identical both internally and externally to the iphone sc 2022 third generation but not 100 the text or imprint on the coverings look different as well as the fact that the 2022 generation 3 battery looks slightly thinner than that of the one in the 2020 sc on the bottom portion of the battery where the chips are components of the battery as well as the flex cable are seem to be a bit thinner on the iphone 2022 sc possibly giving it a slightly longer battery cell now as for the question if the iphone 2022 sc battery would work in the iphone 2020 the answer to that would be no size wise yes it would fit in the compartment however yet again apple has changed the connector very slightly so the connector on the 2022 sc battery would not fit with the connector on the 2020 se here's a closer look at those connectors here's a look at them side by side another difference you can see the main board on the 2022 sc is slightly longer compared to the one on the 2020 se the bottom portion of the motherboard comes down slightly longer as well as the plastic piece on the speaker assembly on the bottom for the 2020 it's slightly longer on the top compared to the plastic on the speaker on the 2022 now as far as replacing the screen from the 2020 to the 2022 the connectors fit perfectly fine and the screen turns on and the display works fine however the touch doesn't work properly sometimes it will detect the touch and sometimes it doesn't now physically between the two screens there are a few more differences one being the layout of the graphite film on the back which helps transfer heat and the second thing i could see is that on the 2020 iphone sc the second generation one there's a one piece metal plate on the back and the graphite film is actually on that metal plate compared to the 2022 third generation one where there's a metal plate on the bottom and a separate metal plate on the top and there's nothing in the middle so on the 2022 the graphite film is attached directly to the back of the screen and when looking at it from the side these two screw holes on the frame are empty since there's no metal plate on the back right there compared to the one on the back of the 2020 where these two screws are in place holding the back of the mid plate in the midsection the same goes for the other side where there's a screw missing over here on the 2022 compared to the 2020. so from the looks of it you wouldn't be able to swap the parts between the 2020 and the 2022 so now let's continue with the disassembly there are six phillips screws and seven tri-point screws that need to be removed once the screws are removed we can begin to remove the covers the flex cables for the screen are adhered to this bottom plate so if we need to replace this we'd have to heat it up and pry that plate off the flex cable for the home button is connected here and that cable can be disconnected by just popping it off and the home button can be removed by pushing it in and removing it here's a better look at the front facing camera the top of your speaker and the proximity flex and this entire flex cable assembly is held on with adhesive so if you need to replace that you'd have to just gently pry it off now back to the main board we're going to proceed to disconnect some more flex cables there's a standoff screw and a phillips screw which are holding down the cover that's covering the main camera that needs to be removed here's a better look at the 12 megapixel wide camera and this camera has ois or optical image stabilization there are seven more phillips screws and two more standoff screws that need to be removed two more flex cables need to be disconnected as well as two more phillips screws there are two more phillips screws on the inside of the frame that need to be removed now this flex cable can be removed as well as the antenna flex cable on the top right side at this point there's one more standoff screw that needs to be removed once this rubber gasket is peeled off there's a phillips screw underneath that needs to be removed now finally after all the screws are removed the mainboard can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at the main board the rubber gaskets around the connectors a liquid damage indicator which is a white sticker over here on top and graphite film over the shields to help transfer heat when the graphite film on the front is peeled back there's nothing visible underneath since the shield is covered and soldered to the main board there's more graphite film on the back shields here's a better look with the graphite thumb on the back removed once the main board has been removed we can see the wireless charging coil in the center cover with graphite film to help transfer heat as also more graphite foam which lays underneath the motherboard there are nine more phillips screws on the bottom that need to be removed as well as one tripoint screw there's a flex cable between the taptic feedback motor and the speaker assembly that needs to be disconnected and the speaker assembly can be lifted up and removed here's a better look at that there's a mesh filter inside the speaker assembly opening and here's a look at the bottom this plastic cover can be removed there's a standoff screw and then there are three more phillips screws that need to be removed two of the phillips screws are on the inside of the frame on either side of the charger port once the flex cable is lifted up the flex cable for the taptic feedback motor underneath can be disconnected here's a better look at the taptic engine now the two microphones on the bottom can be separated from the frame and they're held on with some adhesive and then the charger port flex cable can be peeled off the charger port is located in the center and the two microphones are located on either side here's a look at the other side of it the toggle key for putting the phone in silent mode the volume keys the flash the secondary microphone and the power key are all attached to this one flex cable which connects to the main board with this connector so if you need to replace either of those you'd have to remove the phillips screws which are holding the metal brackets on the inside of the frame which are covering the flex cables and holding the keys in place and you'd be able to peel off this flex cable and replace it for the repair ability score i give this phone a 5.5 out of 10. now it's time to put the phone back together once everything is back in place apply new adhesive and reapply the screen power on the phone and you're done i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll see you in the next one",

damage on it so I'm going to be showing you how to take it completely apart and replacing the LCD part of it alright so first thing what we're going to want to do is we're going to give it heat here in the back cover you can do it with a hairdryer heat gun or you can put it on a hot plate that will heat it up just enough to be able to remove the back cover because it's held down with adhesive some glue on there alright so I'm going to heat it up and I'm going to continue recording now once it's hot enough and show you how to remove the back cover alright so I already gave it some heat it looks like it's hot enough now alright so what we're going to use is a suction cup place it on the bottom portion of the phone and then we're going to pry pull up on it so we until it lifts up just enough to put the prying tool all right so as you can see it opened up its impression so let's take this plastic prank one here all right once you have this in in here you can pretty much just go around the phone removing the adhesive you all right so yeah after you go around the whole phone the back cover will come right off okay so next thing we're going to do is we're going to need to remove all of these screws holding on these this back frame here we're going to need a small Phillips head screwdriver and remove all of these screws okay so once you have all of these screws removed we can remove we can start removing the back pieces here that are on the back of the phone okay so let's pry up on it gently we can use the prying tool to lift up on it all right so the bottom piece comes off then we can remove the middle piece here lift up on it gently all right okay so that comes out as well and then let's remove the top piece okay so once you have all of these pieces removed then next step is we're going to disconnect all the Flex cables let's disconnect the battery first which is this one right here make sure the phone turns off now let's remove the front camera and flex cable this little flex cable over here which is for the volume buttons all right this one down here for the power button the LCD flex cable alright we're going to remove the white and red antenna lift them up and we're going to remove this flex cable right here which is for the home button and then there's also going to be another flex cable right here for the ear speaker alright one more thing we're going to need to do before we remove the motherboard is we're going to have to remove the SIM card tray SIM card an SD card tray let's put that to the side okay once that's out of the way we can go ahead and pry up and the motherboard will lift me okay and then we're going to need to disconnect the charger port flex cable which is connected on the bottom so let's give it some pressure there you go and it disconnects all right so let's move the motherboard out of the way just put this camera to the side okay so next thing we're going to need to do is we're gonna have to give it some more heat on the LCD here and glass because we're going to be prying up on it to remove the old LCD so that we can install the new one all right so yeah I put it on the hot plate for a couple more minutes and it definitely feels like a taut enough now alright so once once you feel that it's hot enough we're going to we're going to get the screen it's good it's a good idea to use gloves or something in your hands so you don't get burned I'm gonna grab it with this alright so next we're going to do that I said we're going to pry up on the top and just wedge a prying tool in there to begin to lift up the glass from the frame all right so then we're going to begin to pry up a little bit harder on it lift up okay so and the LCD cable is going to go in through the hole here and come out okay and then we're going to be careful towards the bottom here because the menu and back buttons are glued on to the frame as well so yeah you're going to want to use some kind of prying tool or some kind of tool you can use to hold down the back buttons down here so that it doesn't come up with the glass all right so the screen came out completely okay so once the glass is removed completely next thing we're going to do is I'll go around the frame carefully and check that there are no glass pieces or anything left around the frame that might damage the new LCD when we put it in so let's just inspect around the phone an adhesive to make sure there's no that there's no pieces left on there all right so once you have the frame and the adhesive cleared of any glass or any pieces that may be left on there we're going to go ahead and install the new LCD okay so we're going to place it in through here make sure that the ear speaker mesh is on the home button is on correctly all right we're going to place in the cable through the hole through the Flex all right and let's position it correctly okay all right so once the LCD is in there let's give it some pressure so that I can stick onto the frame better all right so after after we're done giving it pressure let's go ahead and place the motherboard back in connect the flex cable first move the antennas out of the way and the battery cable out of the way okay let's lift up this cable all right give it some pressure so the motherboard falls in there completely and now let's connect all of the Flex cables alright let's go ahead and place the camera back in front-facing camera all right once all the cables are connected all right let's go ahead and place the back pieces of the frame back on all right let's put the middle one in first let's place the top one and let's place the bottom all right so once we're done putting this the back frame back on we're going to go ahead and place all of the Phillips head screws back on all right so after all the Phillips head screws are back in let's go ahead and place the SD card and SIM card tray back in alright and then after that let's go ahead and place the back cover back on all right let's let's go ahead and power the phone on so that we can test it out all right so yeah looks like everything is installed correctly again and LCDs working fine I hope this video helped you out if

      "transcript": "hello hi i'm christopher from idoc and today i'd like to show you how you can replace the display of your samsung galaxy s7 edge this repair is kind of tricky because parts like the battery are glued in place you should plan on taking about 60 minutes you need the following tools a steel spatula several soft picks the suction cup tweezers a phillips screwdriver and a spudger i also recommend using a magnetic pad so you can keep your screws organized while you work you can find the tools i mentioned in our shop and if you get stuck on one of the steps check out the guide with pictures on our website you can use the comment function to ask questions now have fun repairing your device before you start the repair it makes sense to turn off your device press the sleep wake button and then tap the display to confirm the command first of all remove the tray for the sim card and the micro sd card in this step you remove the back cover heat the back cover with a heat gun or a hair dryer then stick the suction cup on the middle of your device and pull on it as soon as a gap appears between the device and the back cover insert the pick to open this gap insert more picks to keep the back cover from getting stuck again now you can unscrew the 12 screws that attach the three antennas to the device the upper and lower antennas are for wi-fi and cell phone reception and the middle antenna is for wireless charging all the screws are the same length so don't worry about mixing them up if one of the screws gets stuck when you're unscrewing it just use the tweezers to pull it out now remove the three antennas start with the adhesive strip in the lower right corner use the tweezers to pull it off then start at the top and remove one antenna after the other for the upper antenna insert your tool at about the level of the sim card slot there's a narrow gap where you can insert the tool now carefully lift out the cover and then put your tool to the left of the camera insert your tool at about the level of the volume button to remove the middle antenna once you've detached the cover you can fold it up and remove it for the lower antenna you can insert your tool at the level of the speaker before you continue with the repair you should disconnect the battery insert your tool below the contact and disconnect it from the logic board in this step you remove the front camera use the spudger to disconnect the contact and then remove the camera disconnect the following contacts volume rocker switch proximity sensor the connector for the control buttons and the two antennas for wi-fi and cell phone reception once you've unplugged everything you can take the logic board out of the frame slowly tilt the logic board upward and as soon as you can see the connection unplug the connector now you can remove the earpiece which is glued to the display frame put your tool on the left side and lift out the earpiece in the next step you remove the proximity sensor slide your tool under the cable and use it to remove the sensor now you can remove the vibration motor insert your tool below the motor and start with the contacts now you can remove the audio port first you have to remove the screw holding the port in place then disconnect the contact and remove the entire port now remove the two antenna cables pull them out of their holders and disconnect them from the board to remove the battery you need the steel spatula it's better if you use the flat end so you don't puncture the battery then insert the spatula between the battery and the frame on the side carefully pry off the battery to detach the glue from the frame is pretty tough because the glue is really stuck on there make sure that the seal spatula never pierces the battery the metal could cause a short circuit and could cause the battery to get very hot or even explode as soon as you've detached the battery a little on all sides you can try to insert the steel spatula below it and detach the glue on all sides once the battery comes up a little you can pull it out with your fingers so here's the new display you can tell right away that there's a protective film on some of the surfaces let's start with the proximity sensor we have to take off all these pieces of film because this is where we stick on the parts to make sure they stay in place when they're in the frame here's the one for the earpiece and here's the opening for the front camera here are two thermal pads that go on the pcb last but not least we have the adhesive strips for the battery now we can go ahead and install the battery make sure the flex cable for the middle button doesn't get stuck under it at the front it's best if you start at the bottom and slowly drop the battery in then press it down again so the glue will really stick connect the two antenna cables to the board again and route them past the battery now install the 3.5 millimeter audio port at the lower edge of the device again put the port through the opening in the frame then fasten the port to the board using a screw now you can put the vibration motor back in then you have to put the proximity sensor back in the opening press it on a little to make it stick well then put the earpiece back in its place to reinstall the logic board first plug in the usb connector then tilt the board downward and guide it past the flex cables once it's positioned properly in the frame you can reconnect all the plugs now connect all the plug contacts to the logic board again gently and carefully press them back on you should hear them all click softly into place if it doesn't work the first time take them back off and try again put the front camera back in its opening and plug it to the logic board now connect the battery back to the logic board install the three antennas again click the lower antenna into place at the lower end of the device and then press down the antenna then install the middle antenna again then you can attach it to the device last but not least install the third antenna by inserting it next to the middle antenna and pressing it down once you've installed all the three antennas don't forget the adhesive strips now fasten the antenna with the 12 screws again then put the back cover back on press it on firmly so the glue will really stick to the frame to finish the repair put the sim card tray back in now that you've replaced your display it's a good idea to test the new display so first i remove the protective film so i can see all the details of the display then of course turn on the device pick any app and drag it around the whole screen if the app bounces back instead of following your finger something's wrong with the touch screen if it moves around like it's supposed to everything is fine everything looks the way it should on the display so you're all done congratulations on your successful repair this tutorial is over now i hope you enjoyed the repair you can use

      "title": "Fairphone 2 Teardown - How to take this modular Smartphone apart ! [4K]",
      "transcript": "hey what's up guys still greetings from the T-Mobile press conference and I have here the fair phone 2 in my hands and today I want to show you how to take it apart and do a quick hands- on so first of all my first impression of the smartphone when I have it here in my hands now um it doesn't feel so premium because the back cover um some of some kind of rubber material and it feels like a pretty big bumper for your iPhone but the cool thing is that you can drop that smartphone and nothing will happen so it's really robust you can replace things easily so if the screen cracks that's absolutely no problem and right now I want to show you how to take it apart so let's go and let's check it out all right guys so here's the fair phone as you can see it's booting and I would say let's quickly take it apart then we'll put it back together and then let's see if it still powers on so the phone itself here you can see it um it has softare buttons so um no cap passive touch buttons um right over here and all in all um yeah it's pretty thick due to that um plastic rubber bumper or back cover this is actually also the back cover so you don't need a Protection cover this protects the device pretty well shock absorption and also it goes here over the displays over the glass as you can see here so this also protects your display all right so um here you can see that's a transparent one and I have to say it looks pretty cool so I'm a technical guy and I really love if I can look directly into the phone okay so let's take it apart and there we go so here at the top you can just slide off here the back cover and this is actually pretty easy so um yeah it's just like an iPhone case you just have to get it off and then you can already access the internal Hardware so there we go and here you can see now the battery and all the other internals okay so the next step you have to do is remove the battery before releasing the screen so it's pretty easy even there are prints on there which tell you how to take it apart and here we have the battery so let's um have a look at the capacity and the capacity is 2,420 mAh hours if I remember times from my one plus one so I came pretty good through the day with 2,500 on the Snapdragon 801 so that should be a quite good combination so the battery can also be replaced and you can get it from T-Mobile shops um for around 15 if I'm right and this is really affordable if you keep in mind that Samsung batteries are like 30 or more okay so let's have a look here at the rest of the fair phone and one of the first 177,000 phones so this seems to be some quite early phone but they should work all the same now to release the display there were um two of those sliders here at the bottom in blue pretty easy so just slide them here to the middle to unlock the display and all you have to do now is just slide it off like this and this is really really easy so here we have the display now regarding the connection um here you can see it so we have a couple of those golden contacts there and yeah absolutely awesome no damn Flex cables which you can break when you try to replace your display this looks absolutely nice okay so that's the fronti here also as you can see pretty thin um by the way regarding the specs full HD resolution not really sure if you can upgrade in the future but I guess no it will probably bring out Fair pH fre all right guys so here we have the chy of the smartphone and it includes all the necessary components like here we have the motherboard and as you can see there's some prints on there like for the camera module and here for the top camera model it includes the front-facing camera it includes the earpiece it includes the light and proximity sensor and you can replace all that so this is just a simple part which you can take out by just unscrewing a couple of screws and taking the part out and it also replaces the 3.5 mm headphone check so here we have the rear camera with the um yeah single LED flash this can also be replaced it's that module just fre screws and you can take it out and replace it or even upgrade it so that's basically the main connector which goes to the display so you can see here the golden contact and here we have um I think that's the mine where they get the sources from so pretty cool actually from the inside also the design um here we have the microphones even that can be replaced and the whole top and bottom PCB here with the micro USB port and at the bottom microphone so everything here is labeled antenna which goes to the bottom and here you can see the rear side so it comes with a Micro SD card slot that means you can extend your internal storage not really sure if there's limit and we have two SIM cut slots so this is dual SIM and micro d card so you don't lose one of the slots also pretty cool there some kind of extension port or something like that so this is for um for instance NFC back covers wireless charging back covers so not sure what they're going to do in the future but looks pretty outstanding vibration mode is placed here um also here with the speaker and this is also a module which you can replace so basically if you want to you could just build your own smartphone so that looks pretty awesome so now let's put it back together and we have here the main chassis so the next thing you have to slide in is the display and you can see it right over here so here we have the whole display unit and yeah there we go so you just put it in here like this you slide it back in and then you just have to lock it by moving those blue sliders here to the outside and now display is fixed inside so if I'm right the next thing is just a battery so just Slide the battery in and yeah um phone is almost completed just there's one thing missing and this is the back cover so the bumper here and there we go just put it on and the phone is back um alive and now let's try to power it on to see if it's still working okay guys so as we can see the phone is up and running and just a quick look here at the UI so as I've told you Snapdragon 801 so this is not some some high-end processor but it will actually bring you um through your daily work progress without a problem also games um I mean in the OnePlus One it perform really good and the phone is also really Snappy as you can see this is a bit customized and um yeah it's running Android 5.1 so if you want to have more information just check out the link Down Below in the description and there's also an interview on my channel so

      "title": "Trying to FIX 2x Faulty Apple iPhone 6S purchased on eBay",
      "transcript": "hi there my name is Vince from my mate Vince comment in this video today we're going to be doing another trying to fix it video trying to fix items bought from eBay with very little experience to see if we can get them going again so in this video here it's gonna be two Apple iPhones 6s so obviously if not the latest ones but they're still a very good phone now I'm not really an Apple man myself I'm more of an Android man but yet my daughter and all her friends seem to do you obsessed with Apple products so I thought I had a quick look on eBay and what I liked about it is the spares seemed really really cheap I suppose because there's so many phones that's being broken up you can get a bit of a bargain on the spares so what I did is I bought one phone which was expensive this is a working phone but it's got a smash screen yeah there you go those to crack down there and then what I've done is I bought a cheaper phone now this is pretty good so it was actually coming with their come with everything you were you need oh that's a nice that was hatched obviously I wouldn't be needing now I've got that one out or something else so where yeah it looks like the seller looked after this one alright okay so this one's supposedly working but this one here I got four not a lot of money I think it was fifty fifty pound or fifty-five pounds and this one basically says that I think it was it doesn't turn honor it doesn't charge something like that but then as soon as I bought it I said I've got in contact with me and said it might be locked you know the iCloud blocks so in other words it is gonna be locked isn't it so with this phone here I'm presuming this has done the rounds many times on eBay but as long as this for a working screen my idea is that I'm gonna be taking the screen off this one and putting it on to this one and then hopefully I will have a working phone now money-wise you're not really gonna save much money by doing this because the price of iPhone successes have come down quite a bit now and you can actually buy them from a place or CX in the UK for I think around about a hundred and eighty pounds so I paid a hundred and five for this and I think it was fifty five for that so you're looking at 160 pounds so I'm not going to save any money but if will very little money but if I can get the screen swapped over then it will so I'm just looking why this looks so much darker if I can't get the screen swapped over then basically least I will have hopefully some spares on this so if something else went like the touch ID or something or a camera then I will have leftover spares that that's my thinking behind it I'm wondering if there's a screen protector on here because it just looks so dark always coming on no it just looks a lot darker than this one here you know don't the whites don't look as white maybe it's just purely because this is rose gold and this is a silver one so the condition of this one here is actually the rose gold one is a lot better no SIM card installed cert of a Lips SIM card with no pin lock to activate phone right okay we won't worry about that yet but it does look like it sir does look like it's working yeah yeah that looks from the limited knowledge I've got a five phone as it looks to be it looks to be okay and let's turn this off now as with all these things I've got no prior experience with this whatsoever I've never taken apart an iphone so I've never even owned an iPhone as I said is theirs iPhones in the house because of my daughter but and iPods as well but I've never taken them apart so what you see this video is probably not going to be the correct way of doing it I'm wondering I wonder if that's an aftermarket screen because if you look at it if you look at both of them there this one just looks a lot whiter and blacker you know when they're off than this one here I mean you can even see it through the lens of the camera there and if I swap them over you can still see that that's much whiter than this one here so yeah but as let's say it doesn't really matter because if this one's working then I can swap them over anyway right okay so let me show you the eBay listing of where I got them from so this is the most expensive one here so as you can see a hundred pound and five pound postage and it says here there's a bit of a write up on it it says Apple iPhone 6s 16 gigabytes on Vodafone so that is the the lowest one as far as I know that's the cheapest one was in the case until I notice that other pitted the back of the phone so took it out the case and dropped it within a week and cracked the screen in two places please see pictures but phone works fine with no issues had a new battery fitted a few months ago from Apple it comes with the Box charger cable plug and headphones so where it all seems that you know that seems completely believable so now let me show you the let's call it the dodgy phone because this is definitely iffy alright so this one says Apple iPhone 6s 16 gigabytes again and it's rose gold unlocked and as you can see this one was 50 pounds plus five pound delivery and it shows it in a box but it didn't arrive in a box and it just says on it very little information it just says excellent condition on the external I bought this on the eBay and it won't turn on unfortunately the phone is for parts does not work and as I say when I actually then click to buy it I did get a message from this seller saying that you know do you want a refund because this may be locked to an iCloud account but you know I thought well by that time I'd already seen this one here so I thought in these a new screen so I thought I could swap it over so now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna I know obviously this one's unlocked because I've spoke to the seller and I got him to wipe everything from it but with this one now I'm just gonna put it into the internet just to see if it is locked to the iCloud so to do that what you have to do on the 6s is basically remove the SIM card tray and then on this little bit here down at the bottom here will have what's called a I M II I number and you type that number into the internet and it will tell you whether the phone is locked or not to an iCloud account in other words if it's got Find My iPhone on it or not they're just gonna go to Google om e I well okay so there's loads of websites out there so you don't have to use this one it's just the first one I clicked on but if you have a look there's his iPhone iCloud check activation lock and you've got to put in your I m bi number there so that's exactly what I'm going to do right okay interestingly this is a 64 gigabyte model which is pretty good but it says fine white iPhone on oh it's offer no use to me even if I was to get it working so it's only going to be good for spares because obviously Apple do this to stop their phones getting stolen is that you know it's a deterrent because what's the point of making a phone if Find My iPhone is on because the seller can't do much with it apart from sell it for spares now hopefully this phone isn't stolen hopefully it was you know gone faulty and hopefully it's been sold through approved channels and ended up on eBay but who knows right okay so I would recommend if you ever have an iPhone so first of all on the first thing to do is turn on Find My iPhone because at least then it's gonna deter other people from math no it's not gonna turn for stealing it but if they steal it they're not really gonna make much money from it right okay so what I'm gonna do is I can leave that out and also take out this one as well really curious why that's a complete different color it looks like it's got a screen protector but it hasn't well okay so I've had to buy this special little kit here because you need a special tool for the bottom of these ah look at this alright okay so if you have a look there you can see that I need a special screwdriver for that one but there should also be a screw in there and there's not so obviously this has been apart before it did say in the listing that had there actually changed by airport you would have thought that I would have put the screw back in properly but possibly it's fallen out over time this one here and this one they're both missing okay so that's not a very good start is it right okay let's still do undo the remaining screw okay so for this one you need not point eight forget the name of them now but they're like a little star tiny little star shaped like that if you want them anyway you can buy them very cheaply you can just buy like her a screwdriver just type up in Amazon or Google screwdriver for iPhone that's a shame the other ones missing so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply some heat because I need to basically lift this phone I need to take the screen out from there the metal here and then there's a few connectors at the top I'm just going to get the hairdryer and I'm going to heat it up it was very securely held down - know what let's start with this one here just give that heat up as well I can feel this one moving a bit this has probably been opened up many times oh look what a headphone jack is that where it comes out seems to be it seems to be bit in there I'll check that out when I get it off it's coming there we go probably careful because there's connectors at the top right we have to undo these screws here I can really see those missing screw so this is obviously being played with many times before just need a very small crosshead screwdriver for this topic right now we're just going to pick off these connectors I should then release the screen there we go all right okay so hopefully I can just put this one on that one there mmm no I can't right okay there's a rip on it there I don't think that was done by me now cuz I was quite gentle but I don't think they're the actual ribbons for the screen itself that might be for this front-facing camera or the little speaker up there right okay definitely looks a bit iffy well okay so I really need to try to ease this out I'm going to go by the headphone jack again just in case that's the secret have a look on this one yeah it definitely goes in there doesn't it if you have a look and you see it's narrower there so that must be where you have to pick it open from the headphone jack I'm going to add more heat to it see what I need is I need a flat-bladed I need a flat-bladed tool so I get this out I might try and get a little knife to see if that will help it out and you know what I should have just used the tools that came in a pack look at that now oh that's it there we go I should have just used a I got a very cheap repair kit ages ago for phones just this one here for a few pounds and this little sucker really doesn't work there you go look at it now it's opening up there there we go okay it's coming apart nice thing I want to do it gently just in case that other screen doesn't work this phone as it is is completely usable there we go right and now that's better this just looks better inside the battery hasn't got smudges on and I can see the screws up here right so I'm just going to take off this little plate again at the top this one here I'm not letting the screen go all the way over because I don't want to smash up these ribbon cables longer screw there let me keep them in order there we go right okay so that's been separated right so I'm gonna have to swap over that ribbon cable the one that's snapped on the other one you I need to put it now on to the other the other screen there is like a little bit of a gasket here before I pull that off but it's just a bit of stickiness before I pull it off and we're just gonna see if it already exists on this one here this has got missing screws here as well as phones probably been taken apart all over the place mind you that one there didn't have that weird casket thing on it you you actually check these phones for water damage how I should be a little thing in this SIM card slot pit that shows whether it's being damaged by water I've just noticed that that looks like it's supposed to go on the inside this is the the proper screen here which is broken so I know this works although it's broken and can you see this is flapping around in the wind here when it should be under that slot there so this phone has definitely been there definitely have there's been messed around with a fair bit I'd say you so now we're going to put this onto the good phone and hopefully we might get lucky you they're all back in so hopefully now it will just be a case of putting it back in it working it looks like they have to clip him from the top first there we go well I'm not going to do it too hard because I just want to see if it's working to begin with that's not a good sign is it our screen doesn't work I just heard it is it's not explain anything unbelievable all right and not only is the phone iCloud blocks but also the screen doesn't work as well which is ah which is irritating there's nothing there is there buying stuff on eBay because it just seems that the majority of items are just it just seems to be a place just to get rid of stuff that's just that's her rubbish but to be fair that the the phone with the cracked screen that said that that looks to be working just fine we check for water damage so this is the good phone you see just in there there's a little white she was a little white sticker there just by my thumb kind of little circle so I believe that they should that should go red or something if it's in contact with water let's have look at this dodgy foam well that's definitely got bitter red on that Andra proposed to go more red than that because there was definitely corrosion on the speaker another little here speaker right okay I don't think I'm gonna waste my time with this with this phone I'm gonna put the broken screen back on and unfortunately I've got a look into now getting there a new screen for this but at least I know it's easy to fit I presume when you actually get there a secondhand screen that you've got a change order touch ID over but that should be easy enough you yeah I believe this to be a third parties Green because when I look through here there's no gauze and yet when I look through this one there is gauze so I think that the reason it looks faded like this a different color I think is because it is actually not an original Apple screen which kind of defeats the purpose of having an Apple phone because one of the nicest features often is the screen you all right this is interesting I put the faulty screen you know the one with the crack on it onto the broken phone one with the iCloud lock and plugged in the charger and the screen is working although the phone is not working all right okay so we're back again now and this is actually around I don't know I think three or four days after the bit of filming that you just watched so where I left it before was that the rose gold phone Derr Derr this one which is now working the iCloud locks one was flashing on and off remember I put the broken screen which is this screen here you see the cracked screen the same cracks as before when I put the great broken screen on that unplugged in the chargers you remember it was flashing on and off now obviously the original screen that came with the iCloud lock phone the rose gold gold screen was faulty and that's this screen here even though it looks absolutely perfect it wasn't working so well I'll plug the charger and it was flashing on and off that's just because it was completely discharged and eventually when it had enough charge on it did turn itself on but it had the iCloud lock on it which I showed you and also when I tried to put my sim card in it basically said that you know the Sims not supported so the first thing I did was I I put it into this light recovery mode which is where you hold down the power button and the home button for I don't know what it was like 10 or 20 seconds while having it plugged in to a little laptop or a PC with iTunes on it and then that allows you to put it into it allows you to restore the phone now what that will do is it will get you past a password lock because obviously on this phone there was a well not obviously but there's either a four or a six digit him that you have to put in to get yourself into the phone but that doesn't help you with the iCloud lock now I don't really know how I managed to do it but what I did is now I don't know if this is the the process the correct process or whether I just got lucky but basically it's said to set the phone up or sorry to begin with to set the phone up I have to put a sim card in now I've got a Vodafone sim hence the reason I bought a Vodafone iPhone here well I put the Vodafone one in it said it's not supported but it doesn't tell you what the phone is not - and then when I looked at sim unlocking on the internet I had to know carrier that it was originally with and I didn't know so what I did is I went down to the local petrol station and basically I bought up all the SIM cards for you know for the ones kind of you know in the UK the main ones so I bought three I bought giffgaff I bought EE and I also bought Oh two as well and obviously I'd already tried the Vodafone one and these are these are the main ones is probably up at areas as well but these are the main ones and I got them all $4.99 pH so I thought it was worth the risk because then when I put it in there I can then find out which one it's not - and it was not - the o2 so when I put the o2 SIM card in there it recognized it as an o2 phone so at least now if I do want to get that unlock to Vodafone I can now know that it's o2 but forget about that I've put the o2 wanna know when it was it was working obviously the activation lock was still on there now it gave me an option to set it up using an existing iOS device like 11 point something rather so I got the iPad over brought it near to this and then it started to allow me to set her up using the same as the other iPad but then the activation lock came on and then I think I clicked on something like activation lock help or something or unlock with passcode and all I did was amazingly zero zero zero zero zero zero I did this six times I press zero six times and it unlocked itself so I presume the last owner had the passcode lock whatever as six zeros which does kind of make sense because when you're setting the phone up there's so much to do at the beginning you might just say aha six digit code you can change it to for that did you go but you might not know that when you're initially setting it up and you probably think I'll for the time being I just do zero zero zero zero zero because that's where your thumb is already and it managed to unlock the phone but this phone has severe water damage but still I think it's a bargain for 55-pound I'll tell you why my son is always a son's only nine so he doesn't really need a phone but he's always on about like you know I want to play fortnight on the phone or I want this I want that and this is an iPhone 6s with 64 gigabytes off memory on it so this will play fortnight absolutely fine so basically this does actually work well apart from a few things the touch ID does not work even though this is the original there you know the original touch ID from the phone because I believe when you change the screen over you have to change a touch ID because it will only work as a home button and this does work as a home button but it doesn't work as a touch ID now that's not really a problem but other major problems are Siri doesn't work properly so I might have to look at the microphone up here so when I hold this one down and this is using the microphone from this screen so I don't know if I've damaged it before to swap it over because remember I'm not used to doing this so I might be a little bit more rough than professional would be but if I hold this down what time is it see it's not picking it up it's just picking up the last few what's the weather like can you see it just says what like so it's not it's but that this seems to recognize it after it seems to be initial thing it doesn't recognize so what's the weather like in London can you see it misses the first bit so obviously there's an issue with that there other things and this is the major thing is the camera so if I go to camera now camera let's just point it away from me right it doesn't work and it's not that it's a faulty camera it's a fault on the motherboard because this phone has been submerged there's two little things there's a thing in here the SIM card to check and there's also a red dot up here as well so not a red dot it should be a white dot can you see here and that should show for water them as well so 100% this good phone that I bought hasn't been water damaged but on this one it's got a huge red dot on it so the motherboard itself has got corroded where the camera attachment goes on it and then where it's been pulled off there's it's missing pin so there's absolutely no way now I can get the camera to work but yet the front-facing camera does work so if I hit this button here you will now hopefully see my ceiling there you go look at my hand so it is possible to use the camera but you're going to have the use it you know face the other way and you can't see what you're taking so if I bring it from my current working phone let me yeah let me just ring it that side if it appears to be fine and the speaker and the microphones fine there we go turn that off so basically it's kind of like a half working phone which is more than good enough for my son and the fact it's got 64 gigabytes of memory on it it's gonna be great for gaming so it's kind of like a glorified iPod with the ability to make a few phone calls as well I've got no credit on this to dine out at the moment this is just you know a sim card with no credit but it does all appear to be okay which is pretty good apart from those major flaws of the Siri not working the touch ID not working and the camera not working but I think the 55-pound that is still worth it even if it's just to do a game for example like at like fortnight so basically that's where we are with that one so my son is well happy with that and I'm well happy as well because it's a working phone for a 55-pound really don't fully understand how I got that iCloud thing off it III would I thought you had to put a password in but all I did was that zero zero zero zero zero maybe it was the weird combination off it being you know off for ages followed by me putting a sim card in followed by me trying to get the iPad next to it to set up that way and then putting in the zeros I don't know but either way it just started working i'm unfortunately i didn't film it but this was going over hours and hours and hours looking at it so it'd have been too hard to film so where we are right now is I've got the working phone here that needs a new screen because this screen does not work obviously because of water damage I do have to change this little button here over to the new screen because this silver one was the one that came with the working phone now the screen that was on the working phone 100% is an aftermarket one and this little silver button that was on the screen might not be the original touch ID it might be the aftermarket one in which case in the touch IDs not going to work the seller didn't say that in the listing so hoping the touch ID does work but I'm not going to know that until I swap it over so I did get myself a screen and I also got myself a little spare screw kit as well so I've got to invite a whole lot of screws now I know these are not going to be the original one but I've got the whole lot screws for I think it was like 99p or something like that it wasn't a lot of money and they just come in here so I've got a pack with the silver ones and I also got attacked with the rose gold ones as well and now I'll be able to replace those screws at the bottom because remember the screws at the bottom were missing on that one so you get the spares really cheap that's there that one comes with a couple of screwdrivers as well so where I am now is that I've got some spare screws that I need to put in and also I've got a screen in here it's this one here now I know it defeats the purpose of having an iPhone with a third-party screen it's like I said earlier the screen is the best part but I need to be mindful off the amount of money I'm spending on it because obviously it will say yeah it was a broken up phone to be you know it was a broken phone to begin with I don't want to spend too much money on it and realistically if I haven't got a proper screen compared to I think I'd be probably crappy because I've been actually walking around with this rubbish Vodafone one for the last six months because when decent phone broke and I've just had to revert it back to one from a few years ago so what I've done is I've got one here with the camera and everything built into it so I haven't got to change anything over a part from the touch ID so that's what I'm going to do now I'm going to change the touch ID over and then put it on this phone here and hopefully we will have one working phone and also one partially working phone for 160 pale which will be pretty good so yeah let me get on with that now right so I'm just going to be fast-forwarding through this so basically taking the touch ID off of this one here which is on the faulty screen and putting it onto here and hopefully this touch ID is the original one that came with the silver and Vodafone iPhone 6s and in case that's the third party one and I'm hoping I'm going to put in now what is the original one but it might not be it might just be a third party one because you don't actually need the touch ID you can just be using it as a normal home button but that went in very easy so hopefully there's no damage there feels okay now if you're wondering why it looks a bit funny here is because I took this battery out to put into the good phones I've had to put new double-sided tape underneath it and then I've just left this bit here just in case I do want to pull it out again in the future hopefully I'll be able to just use the self double-sided tape to pull it out it's quite clever how they do it there's a little thing you peel at the bottom and then you gently peel it down it's quite therapeutic you just stretch and stretch and stretch and it pulls all the sticky tape from underneath here as you pull it out and pull it out and then the battery just comes out really nice and easy if it's just a connector here so it's very easy to do well I got to be careful now so I'm going to get all this all the screws ready so when it goes back in it will be it will be fine because I don't want to put that screen when I put it back in over 90 degrees if I can help it they just push somebody to lineup and if you're not careful you can end up damaging the little connectors on here you see or possibly on the motherboard as well right that appears to be in now I'm gonna put that on it there I'm gonna start with the long screw well I okay they're finally in that job took 30 times longer than that should have done purely because I didn't have good screw management and I just threw them all into the same container rather than actually keeping them all separate so that's it really important to do if I ever take one of these apart again well okay so I think we're all done I think everything's back together so what I want to do is I'm just gonna turn it on to begin with without without doing anything without putting all back together I'm not sure dispatch we might be flattened here right so this might need to be charged up because maybe it was on because the screens been out of it for so long so let me just plug it in and see see what happens right okay it vibrated there slightly worrying that nothing's coming under screened well I know the screens definitely on because I can feed it there maybe I need to fully turn it off not sure how to do on these iPhones I think you just let me try it on this one here let me see if I can do it without swiping the screen so let me just turn it on but it's that's the same as that because I know when you change the screen you have to turn it off and then back on again or ideally it should be off to begin with well I'm not sure off the way that you were that you turned these off let me see if I can do a phone button on this one well okay so that turns it off so let me try and do that here now I'm button and this one actually I think that just resets it because this one's turning back on now the other one now here we go that's on now so that's good and this one's on so that's how you reset it so when you change the screen over it doesn't just automatically kick in you've got a weight you've got to basically turn the phone off and on again or ideally the phone should be off it's just that when you're taking the phone apart to begin with then it's you know when you're taking apart it's so easy just to hit the power button well okay so I'm just going to put the passcode in actually says put the passcode in but I didn't have the year trying to think now that I try and set this phone up before I don't think I did right well anyway the screens working so what I'm going to do is before I mark anything up I'm going to put it back in properly so I'm going to take the charger out of it put the top bit in first and now gently push it all the way around and I've got a little air screen here thingy cover on so it's going to look nicer when I when I do that it says touch ID is ready to be set up in this phone so hopefully it will work so I'm pretty sure on the other one it said touch ID cannot be set up okay let's take this off and see touch IDs gonna work enter your passcode hmm we should try something off-screen well ok I must have I must have done this one before well I go finish setting up iPhone touch hide these ready to be sup I just want to see if that works those sim card install will s okay well let me get my sim card stuff sorted out and then I'll come back to this and I'm just gonna charge up as well so I'm gonna come back to this in about 20 minutes or so right okay now I'm not gonna go through a whole set up video on this because obviously that's a different video and this video is already far too long but let me just pop the sim card in I just want to make sure that that touch ID works cuz I'm a little bit bit worried about that right so I put my Vodafone sin in there and it's unlock it also this screen is very dark as well so I want to I want to see if if I can brighten this up so let's just set up touch ID well here we go continue whoops you clicks okay I will look look so it's gonna work yes it does work brilliant I was worried about that because I thought it might be enough the market bottomed and then that wouldn't have worked but as you can see it's a it is working Rudy I should have done this with my thumb but what I'll do is I'll set that up afterwards right okay all right so what I'm gonna do now is just see if I can change the the brightness on this okay what time is it in London okay so this series definitely working now our brightness brightness brightness how do I do that now oh here we got from the pond what brightness ah that's better that's better all right let's see what that looks like right okay well that will do me looks looks good enough just need to put the little special Apple screws back in there now so I got some with the little screw kit that I bought and on the the other phone I'm going to change them to rose gold ones because I took the one out of here alright so they're in there that's all I ever hear doesn't seem to be doesn't seem to be gripping I didn't actually check on the inside to see whether they actually goes into anything or not or whether that's missing but one goes in so it's gonna be held with one screw anyway so that's good who left yet there's no point in having that one there it's only that one that's gonna hold it right okay now I'm just gonna do a quick comparison see now this is OCD for you I a minute ago was more than happy with this phone that I've just changed a screen on until I compared it to the other iPhone and also my daughter's iPhone 7 now I just want to show you this if you have a look at between these so this is a proper Apple screen and this one is the the aftermarket one but the one that came with the good phone unit 105 phone and basically on this one both the brightness are up to full and you know there's quite a good range on it so it when it's low it's almost black and it goes right the way up now if you have a look at this this one here so basically between these two although this is an aftermarket screen they both look as good as each other and obviously with this one here the touch ID functions does work you know the touch ID you know there is it called 3d touch where you press it more than once it's not just a touch screen it depends on how much you press it but now look at this one here so to begin with the touch ID is working which is great but check out the difference in the screen so now if you have a look this is up full and as far as I know it's not in any kind of like brightness mode or anything done it's the sorry it's not in any battery saving mode or anything but when it's down it doesn't it seems to still show up a little bit more than the others that doesn't seem to be the range and when it's full there's definitely a big difference there so if you look at both of them now can you see I mean I'm not sure if that's coming across in the camera and that's not the trick of light in my room because if I put it that way just look at the waves there can you see that this one here is much whiter than this one and this one's not full so on its own this is absolutely fine but when you compare it to another screen like a good third-party wanna presume that's a good one and the original Apple one it's no difference this is an iPhone 7 but you can see there so it's kind of weird so yes I'm still pleased with this but in hindsight now I kinda wish maybe I spent another 10 pound and got a screen that was maybe 25 pounds 230 pounds because then it would be more like this as I say it is just a bit of obsession you know a bit of OCD because if I wasn't looking at these I'll be more than happy with this and it's plenty bright enough but now I know it's not as bright as the others I'm sort of thinking yeah it does look a bit Darla's doesn't it's not very vibrant so I think it would be worth investing in a better screen if I was to do this again well there you go that is my my story off buying faulty iPhones on eBay and in this instance here I'm still more than pleased with it to have these two phones working as well as they do for the price that I got them for so if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you want more fix-it videos please subscribe to my channel and not just fix-it videos more how-to videos as well so that's it take care bye now",

      "summary": "Vince from my mate Vince comment in this video today. Trying to fix items bought from eBay with very little experience. Two Apple iPhones 6s so obviously if not the latest ones but they're still a very good phone. you need oh that's a nice that was hatched obviously I wouldn't be needing now I've got that one out or something else so yeah it looks like the seller looked after this one alright okay so this one's supposedly working but this one here I got four not a lot of money I think it was fifty fifty pound or fifty-five pounds. actually buy them from a place or CX in the UK for I think around about a hundred and eighty pounds. If I can't get the screen swapped over then basically least I will have hopefully some spares on this. lock to activate phone right okay we won't worry about that yet but it does look like it sir does looks like it's working yeah yeah that looks from the limited knowledge I've got a five phone as it looks to be it Looks to be okay and let's turn this off now as with all these things I've no prior experience with this whatsoever I've never taken apart an iphone. one's working then I can swap them over anyway right okay so let me show you the eBay listing of where I got them from so this is the most expensive one here so as you can see a hundred pound and five pound postage and it says here there's a bit of a write up on it it says Apple iPhone 6s 16 gigabytes on Vodafone. I bought this on the eBay and it won't turn on unfortunately the phone is for parts does not work. When I actually then click to buy it I did get a message from this seller saying that you know do you want a refund because this may be locked to an iCloud account. type that number into the internet and it will tell you whether the phone is locked or not to an iCloud account. it's been sold through approved channels and ended up on eBay but who knows right okay so I would recommend if you ever have an iPhone so first of all on the first thing to do is turn on Find My iPhone because at least then it's gonna deter other people from math. screw back in properly but possibly it's fallen out over time this one here and this one they're both missing okay so that's not a very good start is it right okay let's still do undo the remaining screw okay so for this one you need not point eight forget the name of them now but they're like a little star tiny little star shaped like that if you want them anyway you can buy them very cheaply. where it comes out seems to be it seems to is a bit in there I'll check that out when I get it off it's coming there we go probably careful because there's connectors at the top right we have to undo these screws here. doesn't it if you have a look and you see it's narrower there so that must be where you have to pick it open from the headphone jack I'm going to add more heat to it see what I need is I need a flat-bladed. letting the screen go all the way over because I don't want to smash up these ribbon cables longer screw there let me keep them in order there we go right okay so that's been separated right so I'm gonna have to swap over that ribbon cable the one that's snapped on the other one. this is flapping around in the wind here when it should be under that slot there so this phone has definitely been there definitely have there's been messed around with a fair bit I'd say you so now we're going to put this onto the good phone and hopefully we might get lucky you. that said that that looks to be working just fine we check for water damage so this is the good phone. Andra proposed to go more red than that because there was definitely corrosion on the speaker. There is gauze so I think that the reason it looks faded like this a different color I think is because it is actually not an original Apple screen. It kind of defeats the purpose of having an Apple phone because one of the nicest features often is the screen. The original screen that came with the iCloud lock phone the rose gold gold screen was faulty. The first thing I did was I I put it into this light recovery mode which is where you hold down the power button and the home button for 10 or 20 seconds. have to put in to get yourself into the phone but that doesn't help you with the iCloud lock now. I don't really know how I managed to do it but what I did is now. The o2 SIM card recognized it as an o2 phone. It gave me an option to set it up using an existing iOS device. I did this six times I press zero six times and it unlocked itself. passcode lock whatever as six zeros which does kind of make sense because when you're setting the phone up there's so much to do at the beginning you might just say aha six digit code you can change it to for that did you go. When you're initially setting it up and you probably think I'll for the time being I just do zero zerozero zero zero zero because that's where your thumb is already. believe when you change the screen over you have to change a touch ID because it will only work as a home button. Siri doesn't work properly so I might have to look at the microphone up here. camera now camera let's just point it away from me right it doesn't work. It's not a faulty camera it's a fault on the motherboard because this phone has been submerged. There's two little things there's a thing in here the SIM card to check and there's also a red dot up here as well. working phone let me yeah let me just ring it that side if it appears to be fine and the speaker and the microphones fine there we go turn that off so basically it's kind of like a half working phone which is more than good enough for my son and the fact it's got 64 gigabytes of memory on it it's gonna be great for gaming so it's like a glorified iPod with the ability to make a few phone calls. thought you had to put a password in but all I did was that zero zero zerozero zero zero maybe it was the weird combination off it being you know off for ages followed by me putting a sim card in. I do have to change this little button here over to the new screen because this silver one was the one that came with the working phone. say that in the listing so hoping the touch ID does work but I'm not going to know that until I swap it over so I did get myself a screen and I also got myself a little spare screw kit as well so I've got to invite a whole lot of screws now. to be mindful off the amount of money I'm spending on it because obviously it will say yeah it was a broken up phone to begin with. I don't want to spend too much money on it and realistically if I haven't got a proper screen compared to I think I'd be probably crappy because I've been walking around with this rubbish Vodafone one for the last six months. here which is on the faulty screen and putting it onto here and hopefully this touch ID is the original one that came with the silver and Vodafone iPhone 6s. I've had to put new double-sided tape underneath it and then I've just left this bit here just in case I do want to pull it out again. sticky tape from underneath here as you pull it out. The battery just comes out really nice and easy if it's just a connector here. If you're not careful you can end up damaging the little connectors. everything's back together so what I want to do is I'm just gonna turn it on to begin with without without doing anything without putting all back together I'm not sure dispatch we might be flattened here right so let me just plug it in and see see what happens. it off so let me try and do that here now I'm button and this one actually I think that just resets it because this one's turning back on now the other one now here we go that's on now. So that's how you reset it so when you change the screen over it doesn't just automatically kick in. little air screen here thingy cover on so it's going to look nicer when I when I do that it says touch ID is ready to be set up in this phone so hopefully it will work. Let me get my sim card stuff sorted out and then I'll come back to this and I'm just gonna charge up as well. in there and it's unlock it also this screen is very dark as well so I want to. Set up touch ID well here we go continue whoops you clicks okay I will look look so it's gonna work yes it does work brilliant I was worried about that because I thought it might be enough the market bottomed and then that wouldn't have worked. that I bought and on the the other phone I'm going to change them to rose gold ones because I took the one out of here alright so they're in there that's all I ever hear doesn't seem to be doesn't appear to be gripping I didn't actually check on the inside to see whether they actually goes into anything or not. There's quite a good range on it so it when it's low it's almost black and it goes right the way up now if you have a look at this this one here so basically between these two although this is an aftermarket screen they both look as good as each other. On its own this is absolutely fine but when you compare it to another screen like a good third-party wanna presume that's a good one and the original Apple one it's no difference this is an iPhone 7 but you can see there so it's kind of weird so yes I'm still pleased with this but in hindsight now I kinda wish maybe I spent another 10 pound and got a screen that was maybe 25 pounds 230 pounds. a better screen if I was to do this again well there you go that is my my story off buying faulty iPhones on eBay and in this instance here I'm still more than pleased with it to have these two phones working as well as they do for the price that I got them for.",

      "title": "LG Nexus 5x - Screen Repair, Battery Replacement, Camera Fix",
      "transcript": "What’s up YouTube, today we are going to\ndo a tear down and repair video for the Nexus 5X. This phone is made by LG. First thing\nyou want to do is remove the Sim card tray. Take the little tool and put it in the hole\nand the Sim card tray can be removed from the device. Then the back plastic of the phone\nwill unsnap from the screen. It is held on pretty tight so if you make a little opening\nwith your fingernail you can put a little pry tool in between the screen and the back\nframe and you can you can un-pop each of the little latches from the frame and remove the\nback. There is no adhesive which is very nice. Just slide your pry tool all along the edge\nand all the little clasps will come undone. We can see that we will need a screw driver\nto remove the back plastics from the phone. I will link all the tools down in the video\ndescription. To remove the lower plastic bracket there’s 4 screws. Then pop it off the base\nof the phone with a pry tool and remove it. This is actually the loud speaker of the phone.\nYou can see the two contact points down here at the bottom. I will link replacement parts\nin the video description below as well. There are 6 screws along the top. I used the razor\nblade to start the top corner. I just lifted up a little bit then I can unsnap the rest\nof the back plastic piece off of the phone. Here’s the battery connection. Just unsnap\nthat like a little Lego, and same thing with the rear camera and front facing camera. Then\nwe have the LCD connection down here at the bottom; unsnap all of those. Then the mother\nboard can be released from the phone body. Here we see the LEDs for the camera as well\nas some noise canceling microphones and the charging port down here at the bottom. Unfortunately\nit is not replaceable. It is soldered onto the board. So if your charging port ever goes\nbad you are just out of luck, unless you can solder . Here’s a Sim card tray at the\nback as well this is not replaceable either. The battery is held in with adhesive. If you\nare going to pry it out, it is helpful if you have a sturdy medal pry tool. The thing\nyou want to be really careful of though is to make sure not to puncture the battery at\nall. That will ruin the battery. Once it is lifted up just a little bit just switch to\na plastic tool, because you are less likely to rip anything on the battery itself. Here’s\nthe battery I will like replacement batteries down in the video description. Usually they\nare pretty darn cheap. Here’s the rear facing camera. This is a 12.3 Megapixel camera. If\nyou think that’s a weird number it’s because it is. Here is the front facing camera, and\nit is a 5 Megapixel. Pretty cute little guy. Here’s the vibrator motor. You can see the\ntwo gold little springs that are up at the top, and those rest in contact with the main\nboard. That’s how it receives its signal. Here’s the ear piece. It’s got some metallic\ntape along the top. Take that off and put it somewhere safe. You’re going to reuse\nit. If you have to replace the ear piece you want to put the tap back down onto of it again.\nPretty straight forward. It has the two little gold contact points as well that just rest\nagainst the mother board. Here is the headphone jack. It has the same kind of gold pins along\nthe side that communicate with the motherboard as well. Here’s the screen. It is an IPS\nLCD display. Similar to what the IPhones have. If you are going to replace the screen there\nis a good chance that when you buy it, it will not come with the plastic frames. So\nyou have to remove the screen, which is the LCD and the glass from the plastic frame.\nIf your LCD is already broken this won’t be a big deal; just heat it up and pull it\nout from the device. I’m not going to do it in this video just because the chances\nof my screen surviving the removal from the back frame is pretty slim. If you can find\na screen that is sold with the frame intact, so the LCD the glass panel in the front and\nthe back plastic frame. That would be ideal. In the past LG has sold them as whole units\nso hopefully they continue to do that in the future. So you can go ahead and snap all the\npieces back in the phone again. The front facing camera, the vibrator motor, and then\nhere is the earpiece. Going to use that same metal tape to tape to tap it back down into\nplace. Here’s the rear camera 12.3 Megapixels, and headphone jack just kind of pop that back\ninto the little holder that is there on the plastic frame. Then the mother board goes\ndown into place as well. Making sure that all the riving cables are on the upper side\nof the mother board. Then snap those down into place like little Lego pieces. Then make\nsure that the mother board is pressed down along the headphone jack as well; so that\nthe gold contact points will touch the mother board, and receive their communication. Put\nthe battery back into place. Clip it onto the main board. Then here’s something kind\nof cool! So there’s a bunch of pins on the mother board, and those come in contact with\nthis back plastic piece, and that is how the finger print scanner receives its communication\nfrom the main board as well. There is a couple water damage indicators one there on the back\nof the phone and one more, if you saw previously in the video, in the Sim card tray slot. Those\nwill tell if your phone has been wet or not. Put that loud speaker back into place, and\nput all screws in as well. Remember all the tools and stuff are down in the video description.\nThen the back plastic piece will just clamp down into place. It is very, very secure.\nThat back plastic panel does not want to come off easy so you have to use a little bit of\npressure to snap it down into place. If you have any questions go ahead and leave them\nin the comments below. Don’t forget to like if this video helped you or you found it interesting\nand don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks a ton for watching. Hope to see you around.\nFeel free to scroll through my channel and check out some of my other repair videos or\ndurability test videos.",

      "title": "How to Fix Nexus 5x Bootloop | Vlog 112",
      "transcript": "let's go over a phone history bought this new lasted a while dropped it two or three times when I was riding my bicycle across the United States this stops working brought a nexus 5x off of ebay while I was on my bike tour use this for a while and then this got the infamous boot loop got another Nexus 5x 32 gigabytes when I was visiting my aunt in Cincinnati off of Craigslist this worked for about eight months until it started boot looping recently got this Nexus 6 which was the same phone has biked to a broken phone from Amazon while I was in Austin visiting the bonafide hustler for the green room meetup the condition was listed is very good it has LCD burnin in the screen it has Wi-Fi connectivity issues and also it is missing some of the Nexus logo on the back not very good condition this is getting returned and I recently bought this Google pixel off of ebay same thing the condition that was described said the back glass was the only thing that was broken and everything else worked well the speaker doesn't work when I talk on the phone and the microphone doesn't work when I talk on the phone so the boot loop issue on these Nexus 5x has been going on for about a year now people been talking about these on the internet it's a hardware issue a chipset issue a soldering issue a motherboard issue whatever I have recently seen this boot loop fixed video and that's what I'm going to try and do right now fix one of these nexus 5 X's when I start it it shows Google and then it will reset and it will just keep showing google google google it won't actually boot up it's stuck in this boot loop crap now we're trying to get off this plastic covering the look looks like there was some water damage to this phone at some point maybe I was walking around in the rain with it or the previous owner got it what I don't know but yeah that's what this little pink thing is some water damage make sure you take the SIM card tray out at this point and we're trying to pry up all of the plastic but it's easier to start from the corners and kind of work your way around and it gets kind of tricky around here I started working it from the back right on the bottom right here and then the top of the phone and I'm gingerly trying to just slide the guitar picking so this is the hardest part so far was getting this plastic piece off I found at points it was easier for me to use a small flat-head screwdriver and just pressing on the appropriate direction of the clip while trying to pry it off but being very very careful with this piece I think this is the moment of truth so I did all that work on this phone and I cannot give it to turn on luckily I do have another phone I'm going to try it again but I'm not going to use as much heat and as much flux to see if I can get this one to turn on so this is the motherboard out of the second phone that I had got it out pretty quickly I'm not going to put flux on it but I'm going to do a maybe a 20 second spread heat on both sides and see if that does anything low heat 20 seconds that's hot just based off of how hot it is I'm guessing a minute and a half that I put on this board probably fried it but this is the learning experience this is to help the world right all right we'll let that cool down and then I'm gonna install it now that is something I have not seen in a long time I did remove the heat shields I don't know if I'm supposed to put these back on or not but it does look like the phone is booting up which is definitely a solid Wow alright we are back on one out of two is not bad if you want to see if the phone is still working leave a comment all the Nexxus people that are watching this video just because of the title leave a comment and I'll let you know the phone is still working out whatever interval from this video everyone else that wants to stick around for the rest of today's vlog stick around and that phone was fairly easy to take apart compared to a lot of iPhones I feel like that was really easy to get to the ticket to everything everything separated easily screws came out easily everything was really really easy to get to check this out this is a docking like a foreigner camera battery charger I think this is for the 70 this is for the g7x battery and this is for the 110 HS Emily film on the 110 HS for the quick action fast shots I got this so I can charge too bad is that once this right doctor was like being kind of shoddy like if it's not in there perfectly two-point charge there we go we went over most of the weekend sales in yesterday's video also sort of GameCube last night that sold for 75 bucks on Amazon I sold a Nintendo DSi pink for $40 and this one I think went out merchant fulfilled prime so I need to get this to the post office as soon as possible it said this was like a priority order or like a super ship order it needs to be there in two days so I'm going to go take these to the post office and I sold two shoelaces on Amazon and then everything else was like little eBay stuff that we talked about yesterday my mom is at a doctor's appointment so I'm going to load these up and take them to the post office on the scooter take 9:30 right now I want to get them scanned in and out this morning is such an ugly wet day one of the SCOOTER downsides I'm getting dumped on right now I got to put the camera away luckily the rain did not come down until after I dropped off the packages but I did get saturated like I said one of the downsides of scooter life if it's cold and rainy really not good I'm just glad it wasn't coming down like this when I was out there I had really good timing we're getting hit by a tropical storm and I had no idea that Monday yeah that's why the weather outside so crap and also a soul I listed this yesterday on Amazon it is a magic mouse one for Apple glutens a bluetooth mouse I have trained myself to use the trackpad so I no longer need this and this is the perfect example of like what I'm just like liquidating everything that I have that I can sell to help pay for these student loans yeah it's great to have don't really need it 100% especially for the laptop so I'm gonna liquidate it 47 bucks I think I'll get like 40 after fees I don't have that much into it for sure I got it in a lot or I got it at a pawn shop for maybe 20 bucks score listing some heavy-hitter Super Nintendo games on eBay and whenever you list some of the more expensive video games you want to make sure that you unscrew and then show people the board on one of the pictures there are remanufactured in China now and you don't want to not have proof of the one that you sold and didn't return because this is the the board is what's really really important here and you put if you do need this screwdriver this is something that I use all the time you will need this screwdriver specifically to open up Super Nintendo and Game Boy games I will leave a link of all the tools I will take John hardest C's advice and start a frequently asked questions of the tools that I use in the in the description with affiliate links so I can start getting some chump change from affiliates to start putting towards my student loans so there will be an affiliate link for this in the description box and it comes as a packet - it's the one it's a size for Super Nintendo and then the bigger size for the for opening like the consoles and the n64 games I think 1064 games are the bigger size making sure all the games have the save battery that still works still got my profile on it so the save still works so I take a break from listing some video games mom made chicken on a sandwich it's going to be a chicken sandwich and I'm recycling this sriracha sweet and spicy sriracha sauce and

Got another Nexus 5x 32 gigabytes off of Craigslist this worked for about eight months until it started boot looping recently got this Nexus 6 which was the same phone. The boot loop issue on these Nexus 5x has been going on for about a year now. We're trying to get off this plastic covering the look looks like there was some water damage to this phone. corners and kind of work your way around and it gets kind of tricky around here I started working it from the back right on the bottom right here and then the top of the phone and I'm gingerly trying to just slide the guitar picking so this is the hardest part so far was getting this plastic piece off. based off of how hot it is I'm guessing a minute and a half that I put on this board probably fried it but this is the learning experience this is to help the world right all right we'll let that cool down and then I'm gonna install it now that is something I have not seen in a long time.

      "title": "Nexus 6p False Advertising - Teardown - Repair Video",
      "transcript": "Got my hands on one of the brand new matte\ngold Nexus 6P’s from Huawei. I’ll give you a little color comparison between the\naluminum, matte gold and graphite. Which color do you think looks best? Let me know down\nin the comments. I think we can all agree this is a pretty darn good looking phone.\nThis particular tear down video is going to be focusing purely from a hardware perspective. We’re going to start by turning the phone off. Removing the SIM card, and heating up\nthe back glass. Now to remove the back glass I’d say you have a 50/50 shot of getting\nit off in one piece. I heated it up until\nit was too hot to touch with just my fingers and then tried to slide a brand new sharp\nrazor blade between the bottom edge of the lens and the glass itself. Turns out the glue\nheld onto the lens pretty darn tight and it ended up coming off in chunks instead of one\npiece. I tried it again successfully with my graphite Nexus 6P and it worked perfect.\nI’ve seen some guys come at it from the far right side, but either way if you fail\nand the lens cracks, the replacement part is only 20 dollars right now. And I foresee\nit dropping as low as 5 or 10 dollars in the near future. I will link the replacement camera\nlenses in the video description for those of you who need them. Same thing goes for\nthe bottom panel; heat it up and pull it away from the phone. For the next step you will\nneed a screwdriver. I will link replacement tools down in the video description along\nwith the parts. There are 4 screws at the bottom and 2 screws hidden underneath that\nglass panel at the top. To pull the screen out from the body of the phone, you can slide\nyour metal pry tool between the edge of the aluminum and the plastic frame of the screen\nand just lift it out. As we pull the front panel away from the phone, we are left with\nthe machined aluminum back. Now the center of the phone here is aluminum, and the edges,\nbut a large chunk of the phone at the top and the bottom of the back, is pure plastic\nall the way through. Normally I would not care if the manufacturer did this; the aluminum/plastic\nhybrid is still relatively sturdy, but here on Google’s website it says “all housed\nin a contoured aluminum body”. But wait, there’s more an “all metal design”.\nThere’s not a single screw in this phone that goes from metal to metal. As a matter\nof fact, the 6 most important exterior screws of this phone go directly from plastic to\nplastic. It says the phone is crafted with aeronautical aluminum, and indeed the aluminum\nis there, but it’s definitely not structurally benefitting the phone in any way. I feel like\nthis is classic corporate bait-and-switch advertising from Huawei, but let’s continue\nwith the tear down. There’s one screw next to this metal plate, we’re going to lift\nthat off. And unsnap this extension ribbon cable from the bottom. This is what leads\ndown to the charging port. There’s one signal wire here as well we’re going to lift off.\nAnd one screw holding the charging port down. Here’s the charging port itself. It does\nhave one microphone on the back. Here’s the battery ribbon cable. Now to get the battery\nout you have to be pretty darn careful with it. You don’t want to slice the battery\nat all. If you slice the battery it ends up smelling like burnt skittles and will damage\nthe phone. Make sure you do not damage the screen ribbon cable underneath the battery\neither. Here is the loud speaker. Be gentle with those two contact points on the side\nthere. If those rip off, your loud speaker will not work anymore. Here are a few of the\ndovetail joints that I’ve mentioned in a couple of my previous videos. You can see\nhere how thick the aluminum is and how small of a contact point that the plastic screw\nconnections have with the aluminum mid frame. There are two screws here with the metal plate\nthat hold down the headphone jack and the front camera. Here’s the front camera. It’s\nan 8 megapixel. Here’s the headphone jack. Interesting little guy. It has a funky rubber\nhat on it for some reason. Go ahead and put his hat back on. There are two screws here\nthat hold down the ribbon cable for the screen. Going to pop off that connector and lift up\nthe screen ribbon cable just like a little Lego. Unsnap the other side of the signal\nwire. One more screw holding down the motherboard and then we can snap the motherboard out from\nthe frame. Here are a few more of those dovetail joints that hold the aluminum part of the\nphone to the plastic part of the phone. The rear facing camera is here. It has a relatively\ninteresting design; 12.3 megapixels and has that little plastic bit right there on the\nribbon cable. The camera itself sits right between the motherboard. So that little clear\nplastic piece is to help support the ribbon cable of the camera so it doesn’t kink or\nbend. The fingerprint scanner is also replaceable. Now here is the screen. This particular component\nhas the glass, the AMOLED and the frame of the screen all attached as one. This would\nbe the ideal part to buy if you can find it. I will link these down in the video description\nbelow if they’re available. Usually manufacturers sell the glass and AMOLED as one component\nand then you have to use a bunch of heat to separate the screen from the frame of the\nscreen. Usually the display, in this case the AMOLED, will not survive the replacement\nprocess. So your new screen has to work when you re-adhere it onto the frame of the screen,\nand then install it back into the phone. So try to buy it with the frame intact with the\nscreen. Go ahead and set the motherboard back into place. Get the headphone jack with his\nlittle hat. Slip that down in with the front camera. There are two screws holding that\nmetal plate down. Going to snap the AMOLED screen ribbon cable into the motherboard.\nSame thing with this little wire connector. Tuck it down into the side so it doesn’t\nget pinched anywhere. There’s one screw holding the loud speaker in place. Set that\ndown. Charging port goes in. One screw at the top of that as well. Same little signal\nwire cable. Pinch that down and tuck it into the plastic frame. The extension ribbon cable\ngoes from the charging port to the motherboard. Two screws holding down that metal bracket.\nAnd then tuck the other side of this bracket in next to the fingerprint scanner and then\nget that screw into the side. And then there’s one more screw in the left side of the motherboard.\nGet that in and then test the screen before you put it back inside the back housing to\nmake sure everything works. Don’t want to do more work than we have to. Then you can\nset the whole screen contraption and motherboard down into the aluminum/plastic hybrid back\nand then snap it down into place. Two screws up along the top and you can use the adhesive\nthat comes with the piece of glass. Mine still has adhesive on it so I’m just going to\npress it down into place. Worked out pretty well. If you have any questions leave them\ndown in the comments. Don’t forget to “like” if this video helped you. There are 4 screws\ndown along the bottom as well. And don’t forget to subscribe. Speaking from a purely\nstructural hardware perspective, this phone is not all that it’s cracked up to be. And\nI’m pretty disappointed in the overall design. Let me know what you think in the comments.\nLike always, subscribe and follow me on Twitter and Instagram for behind the scenes pictures\nand plenty more tech tear downs. Thanks for watching. Hope to see you around!",

      "title": "OnePlus 2 Screen Replacement Repair With Or Without Frame How To Change",
      "transcript": "hey guys so today I wanted to make a video to show you how to change the LCD screen in the oneplus 2 now this video is to show you how to change the LCD screen with taking the complete frame and everything apart unlike some videos that only show how to change the LCD with a frame so first of all before you get started what you want to do is make sure that your device is powered off then you want to grab the phone and right here in the back cover you scarcely stick your thumbnail or something in that slot right there then you can just pry up work your way around and the back cover comes right off so next what you want to do is remove any SIM cards at this time next what you're going to want to do is use the tweezers or something that's what I use it's something fine and you need to get in here there's three rubber plugs in these screws right here and there's two rubber plugs up here and one here so you need to take those six out I already took them out but I wanted to show you you need to take those out and there's also a white sticker down here on this bottom one we're going to need to remove that next we're going to need to use a Phillips screwdriver size zero zero zero and we're going to read to remove all these 18 screws all the way around they should all be the same size so you don't need to worry about mixing them up include links in the video description for any tools that I'm going to be using today or any parts that I'm going to be replacing anything that I think might be helpful to you include links in the video description below this video so check them out there so next now that you got all your 18 screws all the way around out of there I'm going to just use something like a tweezers here very carefully go in this little slot right here and you can just get that started popped up a little bit then what I'm going to do is hold it with my thumbnail like that so it doesn't pop down and then I'm just going to carefully slide something like this plastic pry tool under here and you can see this is letting loose so just be careful with it it comes loose pretty easy then the whole back just comes right off so next we're going to remove the logic board here and what we're going to do first is we're going to grab this tape right here and peel that off and grab this one over here as well and peel that off next we're going to use a Phillips screwdriver size zero zero zero same as we did to open the back up and we're going to remove this little screw right in this corner here so next we're going to do is we're going to remove these connectors right here with a plastic pry tool or something or your fingernail don't use anything metallic you can remove this connector here if you remove this connector here for the battery got all kinds of connectors remove here let's remove this one here this little one over here and then up here we have this copper tape to remove and then there's a connector that came up with the copper tape but we need to remove that as well the next we need to remove this antenna wire right here as well and I'm going to turn the phone this way and we can just carefully pry up under here and we're going to tip it up this way first watch this front camera so it comes up with it as well because of the headphone jack here sticking in the way we kind of need to tip it up like this and then kind of pull it back a little and then it comes right out so next we want to remove the battery what I use is like a plastic pry tool like this and we're going to start into this corner there's this charging cable that runs right down through here on this side so we're going to start on this side we're just going to carefully pry up under here and this thing's not stuck down very hard so once you get started just kind of get it loose and then the battery will pry right out the next we're going to remove this part down here so first of all let's go ahead and disconnect this connector right here we're going to disconnect this antenna wire right here just connect that connector disconnect that connector now what we're going to do start under this cable right here it's just stuck down with adhesive and then you want to watch this right here and make sure that this pops loose so you don't tear that off have that come down along with it make sure that this prides up pretty well then what I found for this bottom part if you get under something and kind of just rock that a little bit it's just stuck down and once it's loose you can just grab this and kind of wiggle that out then that part comes out then we're going to want to just pry up on this board here and that comes out we want to grab this antenna wire pull that out and we want to get this earpiece speaker up here at the top I'm just going to use something fine like a tweezers you can get in here just kind of flip it around there it just kind of sets in there with no adhesive so you can just pop that out of there next well to remove this proximity sensor right here so to do that we'll just grab this rubber piece and pull that out of there then we can just pull up carefully on this connector right here and this just has this great adhesive on it and you just pull that out so now I would recommend buying the screen with the whole frame and everything included if you can they're getting kind of hard to find but if you can find it it saves a lot of work but if you can't you're gonna have to go on to this next step and I'll show you how to remove this frame right here so what you're going to need to do is have like a hairdryer or a heat gun or something include a link in the video description for heat gun if you need one we're going to want to do is flip the phone over and we're going to need to heat all along here and you want to probably heat for a couple of minutes you don't want to get it too hot but there's nothing really that can get too damaged so what you want to do is especially start in this corner right here by the front camera is a good place to start and now this may be kind of hot to touch when you're done heating it but what you want to do is just carefully and use something that doesn't scratch and I say like this plastic pry tool right here and see if I push really carefully right there that screen starts separating so what I ended up doing is got a guitar pick in here and it's kind of hard to do while you're pushing in on this part here but I ended up using my thumbnail to assist a little bit just to hold it open like that so I could get this in here so what we want to do is we want to have that hold it so it can't close up again then we want to give it some heat don't go too far we get some heat every so often and it shouldn't come too hard and we're just going to keep working it I just slid this one down here so I'm going to try to attempt to slide this one this way and you can see it's separating there all the way it's starting to separate if you have several guitar picks that are handy to have and what we're going to do is just keep going around here so now if you have one in this corner here if you have more than one you can just keep something in here to slide this down as we go here maybe keep something up here to keep this apart if you need to excuse all my fingerprints on the screen it's hard to do without getting fingerprints on it and they should be able to slide nice and smooth like that if you got enough heat on it as you can see in there there's some adhesive sticking but it just let loose now you want to watch these connectors back in here now as you pry up art watch there's this sticky part right here that wanted to stick to it but otherwise that was the only thing and then it just pulled out then the whole screen comes out just like that next we're going to want to peel up this yellow tape right here holding these connectors down try to get under them and pry them up and why I found if you to take these apart separately it's easiest just to cut down through the middle of these to split this tape in half then when I carefully get under this right here and just pry up it's just stuck down with adhesive on a peel data I'm going to get under here and pry this side up - now that that's hides pried up then we can just pry under this middle part right here then that part comes out the touch buttons next to change the home button fingerprint sensor what we can do is just get under this yellow tape right here loosen that up then you can just get under it with something like this pride or something and it just has strong adhesive under you can just carefully pry up and this part comes right out so next we want to transfer this home button over to your new screen just check did he sleep on it make sure that's laying down nice then we're just going to grab it and set it down in here press the tape down next to reinstall your touch buttons just grab and set it down on here let's line up that side right there and up that side right there I'm pretty much line them right up with the holes where they go and we'll press our tape down there make sure it's stuck for reassembly we want to grab our mid frame we want to grab this part here we just want to make sure to start the wires through this hole in this hole right here so you want to make sure that this wire started through and that these two wires are started through then what we want to do to make sure that this is seated down right if we want to apply some heat again we want to press down all the way around once I have some heat applied so once you applied some heat you can also hold it down on a flat surface like this just kind of hold it in till it cools off and that helps for the adhesive to set nicely then we're ready to start reassembly go ahead and set this down in here let's reconnect these connectors right here grab this antenna wire and set it down in here reconnect it where it goes to make sure the wires in his channel here don't grab the charging port and set it down in here to get this part bottom part in here first we need to keep it tipped up it needs to be tipped up partly as you slide it in here and then set down then you can press it down then let's reconnect this connector here and as we're coming up through we want to push this down where it goes that has two pegs where it hooks on to and we can just continue to stick this back down all the way up through next we can grab our battery and set it down in here press it down then we can grab our earpiece speaker and set it down in here now if you look the part that's sticking up the furthest up towards you that needs to go towards the bottom like this direction so that just presses down in there next when I grab our proximity sensor and set it down in here first and then push the tape down so you also want to put your rubber piece back in here on top of the proximity sensor to reinstall the logic board what you want to do is you want to make sure first of all that this mute button is all the way up and then you want to make sure that the switch and the logic board is all the way up if it got bumped in any way if it got down too far then you're going to not be able to line it up in the right here so we're going to need to move both to the top position so to reinstall it just grab your logic board set it down in like this now when you set it down you'll have some things to watch you want to watch this antenna wire right here you want to watch this connector over here all these different connectors in the way here and this antenna wire yet again all these different connectors you want to watch as you set it down in here you want to make sure that you're tucked down in here good when you press it down otherwise the logic board can't come far enough forward to set down properly so it's not quite seating in here then that's usually the problem is it's not down quite in the front here and far enough forward then you want to grab your screw and put it in here then we'll start reconnecting things so let's go ahead and start reconnecting some things so let's reconnect this push the copper tape back down let's reconnect this connector reconnect this connector reconnect these two and also let's reconnect this antenna wire right here make sure it's pushed down in its channel the wire when you're done let's grab our tape and put it back on here and you're all set to put the back part back on just grab the back part set it down on here just press down clip it in and go ahead and put all your screws in all the way around once your screws are back in make sure to put these three plugs back in here and the three rubber plugs in the bottom right here be sure to install your SIM card next and grab the back cover set it right down on here make sure it's pressed in all the way around and you're all set thanks for watching",

powered off at this point as well we're going to go ahead and remove the SIM card slot you want to take out all the screws around the backside there's about six of them covered in these little grommets we're going to use our little pic here to pop these off of the phone there's two down here in the middle by the charge port one just slightly above it be careful these things like to pop right out ones to the left of the camera and then two above the camera all right now factum I can go ahead and remove all of the screws off the back and yes I know that I could fast-forward through this but the goal is to show you how much time it takes to do this so we're just going to work our way around the phone these aren't put in their extremely snug so it'll be too difficult to get them out now there is a piece of litmus paper covering the screw in the bottom left hand corner you can just basically unscrew that out just so you know and I hope everybody already knows this whenever you disassemble your phone you are avoiding its warranty I'm pretty sure that should just be known I'm not sure there has to be disclaimers on that for people but yeah if you open a device you avoided its warranty that litmus paper on this phone is what tells oneplus that we've gone ahead and voided the warranty on this phone by opening it up so we'll get all these screws out of here now going to see a future disassemblies hit me up subscribe to my channel go ahead and share this with other people so I can gain more views for more phones and if you have questions or comments throw those down below and I'll do my best to answer those for you as well all right there we go we have all the screws out of the back of the phone you see right here is a list people are talking about so there's a screw underneath this and we're just going to dig below so we can show it to you so just a little thin piece of paper you're going to put your screwdriver in there and pull it right out now with that done we can go ahead and remove this plastic back cover off the back of the phone go ahead and pull it up and pop it off nothing fancy here just a few connectors now you can see on the back of the phone have that lovely red battery it's pretty cool this is a fairly well laid out foam but it's kind of reminiscent of a Sony phone to be honest with you so we're going to go ahead and pop this tape piece off there's two connectors underneath it one's for the battery and one cable connects the bottom daughter board to the top logic board the connector for the batteries the one just to the left this one right here is the reconnection so we're going to pop that off first and this one is the connection to the board below so we have a connection right here we go ahead and pull this off as well and put this right above undo both of these cable connectors I believe that one's for the screen and this one is for the selector or start the volume power button rocker buttons on the side now we're going to go ahead and pop off the connector up here there's a little gold piece of tape over it we'll use our tweezers to pull that out this grounding cable and protip just say no put the tape back as close to the connector that you took it off of as possible make it a lot easier to remember where that tape goes and pop this connector off here as well and then we can pop the connection off for the front facing camera we can pop off this wire antenna connection here as well we have a screw right here when I go ahead and remove this is not the same as all the other screws so make sure you keep it separated now we can go ahead and work our way up the board upwards so we're just going to wiggle it back and forth a little bit so we can get it to start to pop up there we go so I found the easiest way to remove this is to pull the board get it free pull the back end of it up just a little bit then you just slide it back in towards the battery I'll go ahead and pop right out for you now there is some thermal paste on here probably for the Snapdragon 810 so it doesn't get overheated that's what that pink stuff is make sure you don't play that too much now we can go ahead and get started on the remaining portion of the phone here so you can see we have connectors across the bottom now these all run basically underneath the battery or into the display screen these two connectors are pulling up right here or for the capacitive buttons and the touch sensor I believe so we can credit a pop that's battery and the reason why unpop those is sometimes when you have cables running out to Neath the battery try to pull it up I don't want to come up with it so you can use your spudger to pull this out I like to use a nice flat tool like this I accessible tool you can use a putty knife or up low or a nice wide spudger will help you out as well so we're trying to figure out where exactly it's adhesive is at and that looks like it's probably dead center in the battery so I'm just taking my time I'm not being extremely forceful we want to bend the battery too much I'll go ahead and slide it out for you so you can see right here it's kind of a L shape here is the adhesive portion for the back battery now if that done we can go ahead and remove the front-facing camera out of its slot they can pop out the earpiece speaker if your new frame assembly doesn't come with one as well just same way you popped out the front-facing camera now down here across the bottom because we have a few connectors this ribbon cable runs all the way down towards the bottom is actually part of the charge port and this wire antenna cable runs all the way down the phone as well as we can go ahead and remove that so let's go ahead and restart to remove the charge ports we can remove the bottom portion of the board here and to remove the charge port we're going to do is we're gonna go ahead and loosen this cable up so go ahead and pull it back down stop just a little bit short of this connection here just go ahead and pry this up got a couple of posts where the ribbon cable sits on top of so just go ahead and gently pry this up and put this down and my understanding is these little connections on the ribbon cable actually our four backs in the Chinese version of the International Version now this cable what's kind of tricky and it took me a little bit of time to figure out most of the time they'll just slide back and just pop right out for you this particular cable it's in there pretty good the best way to do it is to actually pull upwards on the very back corner and then we'll go ahead and release it it looks like there it doesn't seem like there's a little bit of adhesive underneath it but it is in there nice and solid just taking a look at this board here you probably pop this board out before we actually move the charge port cable when a manhandle it too much you're just going to wiggle this cable back and forth a little tiny bit of adhesive underneath that I'm going to bed and release that as well that has your vibration module on it so you can see that it one still will go back and forth so what we're going to do is just try to see if we can't pull it up on the back here so you can't pull it straight out like I'm trying to do here there's an indentation in the frame of the film that this sits into it kind of holds it in place so we're just going to end up pulling it straight up here I still want to damage it there we go see we popped it out right there so it looks like there's a little tiny bit of adhesive underneath it on a black spot alright and that is basically this assembly for the phone you can either change your volume button or your power button basically you just need to take out this little grommet piece in the middle and then pull this piece of metal out or this little board and go ahead and slide the new one in then put the grommet back in the ground why I'm talking about is this one right here let's go ahead and pull it out that will help release it same thing for the volume rock or the notification rocker on the opposite side just so a reverberant cable there as well I'm starting out actual ribbon cable but just a slider the actual button is on the phone itself the rocker so so I'm going to be aware of if you do break that's going to be very difficult so hope we can find this assembly portion put together so you'll have to try to remove this screen these two cables down here for the capacitive buttons in the home button that's the disassembly if you haven't find this useful hit that like button as always thanks for watching peace",

      "transcript": "hello friends welcome to this new tutorial today I have here this LG g4 and as you see it stacks on the LG logo it's been like this for a couple minutes and this problem is a common issue with energy devices because the processor is getting too hot which make which prevent the phone to load the system and turn on so today I'm going to show you how to fix this problem actually I am I gonna like use two methods to solve the problem at the same time so please like watch the video from the beginning to the end if you have this problem and after that you can apply what you see in this video because sometimes me I don't want you to stuck in the middle of the process of the process if you don't have the ability to fix your device so please watch the video from the beginning to the end and so we will have like an idea about all the steps that you're gonna go through and after that you can apply what you see all right Kay so let's start to do this job you will need like some tools we will need an IC semi and we will need a Phillips screwdriver and we will need some like plastic like this one's a guitar pick and less badger and we may need a heat gun I say we will need it differently and also you may need like a foil and the piece of paper okay so let's start first of all I will turn this one off by removing the battery after nothing will open all these screws to move the memory card the SIM card by the way the screw is all the same so we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven eleven screw I will remove them all and they will come back to you all right guys I remove all the screws they are here somewhere where I can put them just here I put better the memory card usually I put all the stuff on this back cover so I keep them all together alright so now I will use the I see Sammy and they will come to the edge here to the corner then we lift up make sure don't answer this I see Sammy or a knife or whatever you are using deep inside because there is like some components here you may damage them with this okay I forgot one screw here if you feel like this is like hard to remove don't use any force just check if there is like any screw left there so I have one left here and now it can remove the back cover or the bitter cover put it aside so now we have here the motherboard the motherboard has three cables holding it we have the LCD cable here and we have the front-facing camera and we have the rear camera or the main camera so I will disconnect them one by one I'm just gonna use my nail if you use like the tools you may use this plastic this bugger but be careful there are a lot of components here you may damage them when you are using this one that's why I prefer to use my nail and grab only the edge of this cable and disconnected the same thing here go to the edge and disconnect this and camera also and now and we remove the motherboard put it here and this part we don't need it we're gonna put it aside and now I will go back to the motherboard and as you see here I have this bracket this one I will remove it from here so the bracket we come here to the edge and we lift this up like this it's disconnected okay this bracket we're gonna put it back here alright so now here we have this is the processor and this is the chip where all the stuff on this phone are like stored here so this is for the data you have your pictures your contacts everything is on these components and this is the processor which is managing all the things that's going on on the phone you are using it so this processor is getting hot I mean it's overheating and when it overheats it stuck it stacks on the LG logo it cannot load the processor I mean it cannot load the software so you cannot use your phone always it starts on on that screen which we show in the beginning and the more the phone is stuck on that screen the more the phone is getting hot so before we start applying any like any solution for this or any repair I prefer to check the battery you may like replace the battery it may solve your problem but because I don't have a battery I'm just going for this repair I supposed to mention this in the beginning but I'm machine it now so that's why I recommend that you watch all the video from the beginning to the end because like sometimes there are like some advices during the process it may help you to solve your problem without like going through the whole thing so replacing the battery may solve your problem try the battery first all right so now we are here what I'm gonna do I will heat up this processor and when I heat it up I will heat it up up to six minutes and why I'm gonna heat up this processor because this processor has has a connection dots underneath which is like make a connector to the motherboard and this connection get get lose some time and it's not connecting good to the motherboard which makes the process who keeps looking for ways to load the information but since this there is a bad connection it will stack on the LG logo this is one one thing and what we gonna do we're gonna heat up this processor like up to six minute it depends how much the heat gun that you are using is hot for example the one that I'm using is this one and this is very hot which means I'm gonna maybe like heat up this a couple minutes maybe like two minutes maximum because this is very hot if you are using the hair the hair dryer you may like keep applying the heat here for up to six minutes okay but always watch out and if you see like the smoke or if you feel like the motherboard is too hot stop do not like burn the motherboard okay so let's heat up this I will just like first heat up all the mother would like this and what's the motherboard is hot I will focus on the processor and make sure don't put this one somewhere and you heat it like this you may burn whatever is Internet they feel that the motherhood is too hot so I'm gonna stop right now all right that's enough I think it was one minute because the heat gun that they have it's like a really hot so now I will put this one side and we put it here we just put this underneath to not burn anything in the bottom and now I will prepare one small thing so I will use this one this is a boiled and they will need a plane not plain car something like this they will cut a piece of it exactly the same size like the processor so I will cut this piece see the business card you can make it a little bit more okay its equal it's almost the same size like this one all right so now I will take this small piece and they will fold it here make sure it's not too thick because if it's too thick it may it may like show a spot because this will be faced in this place here on the top and it may like show a spot here on the LCD like a black spot or like a white spot because of the pressure so make sure it's not too thick as you see maybe this size it's Emma so what I'm gonna do now I will put this one here on top of this but I need to just need to stick it you know so let me use like some kind of I will use this this is the solder flux I will just put a little bit here as you see just to make this thing sticks here all right so now I will stick it like this but I will make sure no no extra like nothing is extra because this may touch the sides here alright it sticks very well so now what I'm gonna do I will use and we put this bracket what what is the role of this thing here this will like suck the heat when the processor gets overheating this will suck the heat and it will transfer it to this piece here and it will spread it on this bracket which will spread is also on the motherboard and thus will cool cool cool the processor ok so let me connect this one there is like small channels here and we need to put the edges of this bracket on the channels make sure they are aligned very very good with the channels yeah well if you put too much if the piece that you put inside here is too thick it will not it will not this piece not gonna stick here okay it still rise up from this side but it is not problem we want it to be like that alright so now I will put this back here connect the cables and put the back cover and now I will put the screws one two three four those are the first schools that I'm gonna put back so I have here four screws we start with the ones in the side here okay if you have a spot here on the screen you can untie to this this screws a little bit just little bit alright so now we will finish putting all other screws and they will come back after I finish just to save some minutes or some second alright so I put the last screw here now I'm gonna put the SIM card back and the memory card and they will put the battery and turn the phone on as you see the LG here and if the phone like go through the steps to turn on quick that's a good sign if not you may need to flash the firmware on it all right as you see it turns on its weight while waiting for it to turn on I just want to mention that I fixed phones for a long time if you have any issue like just feel free to text me or comments comments and they will get back to you as soon as they can I have like more than 18 years experience on fixing this mobile devices phones computers and tablets and also don't forget to hit the thumbs up because this will help us a lot almost F wala as you see the phone is working so the first thing you need to do when you when you turn your phone on like this go to the connect this one with the computer or transfer all the stuff that you have here to the memory card because this is to be honest with you this is a temporary fix it may the phone may work for you for a couple a couple days a couple hours I don't know but I think this is a temporary fix so you can you need to backup your data as soon as possible alright guys I hope that this video helped you to solve your your phone problem if it does please hit the thumbs up

      "title": "LG G4 Tear Down, Screen fix, Phone repair video",
      "transcript": "In this video I’m going to show you how\nto take apart and fix a couple things on the LG G4, one of LG’s newest smart phones coming\nout in 2015. This one has the leather back with the center\nstitching. Go ahead and turn off the phone first. Remove the back cover. Pop out the battery. And then you’re left with 11 screws to take\noff from the back housing. And then I found that it’s easier to grab\nalong the center of the battery hole and the edge of the phone to start pulling away that\nback plastic plate. You can just unsnap it from the edge of the\nphone and the whole thing will just come lose once all those screws are out. Pretty straight forward. This phone is actually pretty darn easy to\ntake apart; nothing is glued down or adhesived like the Galaxy S6. You can see these little gold contact pads\nthat just kind of rest on top of the motherboard. That’s how the power buttons and volume\nbuttons communicate with the motherboard. The bottom part of the bracket also snaps\noff. This is how you replace the loud speaker. You can see the loud speaker segment in this\nbottom section and the gold contact place that just sit on top of the motherboard. LG’s a big fan of those; they always have\nbeen. Here is the buttons, the volume buttons and\nthe camera lens. Pretty straight forward and easy to replace. If your camera lens gets scratched or broken\nit’s pretty easy to pop out and pop in a new one which is nice considering that the\ncamera lens is easy to scratch. Here are the buttons ribbon cables. You can just pop those out and replace them\nwith a new one if needed. The ribbon cable for the screen just snaps\nup like a little Lego piece off of the main board. Be careful with any connections or chips down\naround on the main board, you don’t want to pry up on those when you’re lifting up\non the ribbon cable connections. The motherboard just pulls away from the plastic\nframe of the screen. And you can see here the contact points I\nwas talking about earlier. Here’s the SIM card slot (that is not replaceable),\nbattery connections, and the charging port (not replaceable either). You can see the back here as well. You might be able to do it if you had some\nmicro soldering tools but that’s beyond the scope of a normal person’s capabilities\nso we’re going to skip over that. Here is the front facing camera and the vibrator\nmotor which is pretty small in my opinion. Usually with phones and even watches they\nare a lot bigger than that. Here is the rear facing camera. 16 megapixels. Capable of recording in 4K. It also has the image stabilization chips\nthat you can see on the side of it. Here is the earpiece. I’m going to lift off the little ribbon\ncable first; it has some more of those contact points we were talking about earlier. And something else I found interesting is\nthere are these little contact points on the side of the motherboard that just clip in\nnext to the headphone jack. And that’s how the headphone jack communicates\nwith the motherboard. So here’s the screen. It’s a combination of the glass, digitizer,\nLCD and plastic frame. If you are going to replace the screen you\nhave two options: one is to just buy the glass and LCD combo, or buy it with the frame, which\nusually ends up costing 10 or 15 more dollars but will save you hours of work and frustration. So if you’re going to do a screen repair\nmake sure you buy the screen with the frame included. You will thank me later. Put back in all the components. Got the vibrator motor, the rear camera, the\nfront facing camera and ear piece all placed back in; making sure that it lines up with\nthe little pins on the side. And then when you’re placing the motherboard\nback into place make sure you lift up the ribbon cables of the cameras so they don’t\nget caught underneath the motherboard. There’s only three to worry about so it’s\nnot too bad. And make sure the motherboard slips inside\nof the plastic clasps at the top and the bottom. Just kind of press it in. You’ll hear it click into place to make\nsure that the motherboard is secure. Putting the button back together. I put the center button down first, just kind\nof eye balling it, and then the top layer just clips down over the top of it. And then press it a couple times to make sure\nthat everything’s clicking and you don’t have anything stuck underneath there and it’s\nall cleaned out. And try not to touch the inside of the camera\nlens either if you go to replace that. That will make it so that your pictures are\nblurry later on. I’m going to clip the back frame back together. The loud speaker is connecting to the rest\nof the device. Making sure that the ribbon cable for the\nscreen is clamped down to the motherboard. It’s kind of like a little tiny tiny Lego\npiece. It has a bunch of little fins that just clamp\ndown onto the motherboard. So you have to line it up perfectly and then\njust clip it down. And you’ll feel it snap underneath your\nfingers as it clicks into place. Getting the back housing pressed into the\nframe of the screen. Getting the battery back in there. And then I’m going to test it before I put\nthe screws back in. Now the back cover’s in place. I’m going to go ahead and give the phone\na try…and everything works. If you have any questions leave them down\nin the comments below. Don’t forget to “like” if this video\nhelped you. And don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks a ton for watching. Hope to see you around.",

      "title": "Temporarily Fixing Bricked LG G4 Boot Loop - Recover &amp; Delete Data [ 4K ]",
      "transcript": "he was going against welcome back to another video and today we're gonna be tempting to fix my LG G or four phone so apparently my g4 wasn't safe from killing itself I thought I had the newer models and apparently nope given the newer model has failed on me basically I was using it watching YouTube and all of a sudden OOP it's froze and I'm like hold on I've never had this film freeze before that's not good so it turns off I try to do it again it doesn't work check the battery put it back in turns on and then turn it off it gets stuck on the LG logo and it shuts off so that's that's about it now I haven't turned it on in a few days now there's a possibility it might go somewhere and then just stop Midway so let's see what happens meanwhile I've been using this Xiaomi me five replaces thing what unfortunate really like this thing the speaker is just awesome and it's just a really nice phone but it died and that's something LG has to really work on I mean all the phones are just cool really nice phones and I can see it's not working it's no flashing with the blue light instead so and it turned off so yeah um LG makes great phones like they got some really nice features that are the phones are almost perfect and then they die or they would overheat or the battery drain like in the g3 it's just a big massive LT I'm looking forward to their V 30 but that's the expensive end anyways we'll go ahead and tear it down and I'll show you guys what I'm gonna do and basically just gonna go ahead and heat up the chip and see what I can do about it but that said axon tells me on this new setup here in this other room and have on the action cameras running right now and recording an external audio on this thing and I am pretty much testing out the camera this new mounts as well as a new microphone on this new table in this new setup it's a lot of stuff but yeah this is gonna go obviously on my soul chimera channel as you probably have been watching it now just pretty much where I'm gonna be taking apart stuff showing you guys DIY computer builds and whatnot and anyway we're very open finish off taking this motherboard apart and you can see how easy I took it apart I didn't even take me like it to probably took me a minute or so to open this thing up which is pretty awesome because you can easily service it right now the plan is to really just get it working just enough to get my data out if I have anything on it usually all my stuff is on the SD card and format it just flushed out oh yeah that's pretty much it for this assembly it's pretty simple I mean LG phones just gotta love them it three-part look so we have the buttons we have the speaker and that's the back panel then we have them on the board with all the stuff and then you have this part which has the display the digitizer the vibration front piece and one on and all that good stuff put that aside and now what we're gonna do is rip open this shielding right here so I can get access and get direct airflow using my my hot-air gun from the workstation over there there we go and can I take the other quarter out no pebble clicks butter but that probably an antenna is on them okay so let me show you here all right my water bottle that's my workstation do 200 degrees let's actually take out the nozzle here don't want too much data careful yep totally forgot about this other part let me go take it to that apart as well it is now hot to touch so that's great for me there we go okay back to work I'm actually going to also apply some pressure flip it over because we were making a pancake right now all right I'm gonna leave you here and we're gonna wait for it until it cools down put it back together and see if it works all right see you in a bit our axle has finished cooling down I can touch it and we're just gonna go ahead put it back together and just hope for the best that it's gonna work for at least five minutes below while I check if there's anything that I can recover and yeah rest in peace LG g4 you have really served me well for the past two years or so I'm not even gonna bother putting the screws in I'm just gonna go ahead and test it out and see what happens all right here we go putting a blue light we are getting a blue light everyone well then you have just saw what I saw a big flash of whatever that was a bunch of glitches still flashing blue them I'm just gonna leave it to see what happens it's tip it's flashing the backlight on and off and that's it oh oh oh what is this wait for it wake up come on wake up I think it's still failing it might just shut off all of a sudden what is going on here let's go plug it in we're always still failing yes success I mean we're we're pretty much in right now we're take a look at the inside see if I have anything yeah I have a lot of stuff I haven't bathed maybe naturally maybe not a lot of videos by the way I'm just gonna drag it out and save them okay they're still lying it yep still lagging are still gonna let this do its thing and once I finish backing up we're gonna see if we can get any further than a laggy interface because I have no idea what's going on here insane I did see a white box flashing damn it this thing is dying this is sad I mean this is a sad sight for this phone it's got a great speaker it's got a great camera a reboot might help but you gotta finish backing up first make sure I don't have anything that I need to take care of or save what I can just a bit here all right so we have a new progression and getting worse check this out okay never mind literally have the screen was only updating this half of the screen stayed the same the other it's just updated well it's the laggy though come on finish copying so I can restart you and make sure that you're not completely dead I mean I'll be happy if it just works I'll just let it sit on my shelf along with every other phone that I've ever owned and call it a day I mean don't want to force you there buddy don't want to force you there oh yeah this time I got it captured on camera the flash hopefully showed up okay I think that's pretty much it for the backup part of it let's just connect and I've just killed itself literally I was go back to cry record and pull it out and then just killed himself now we're getting flashing blue light we've done the actual logo that time would actually go ahead and open it up back up and try to take the motherboard out and power it externally because I feel like I have damaged something I'm not too sure open back up one more time and hopefully we'll get somewhere further actually I'm gonna go ahead and take the covers out as well all right so I think what happened here is the the actual board has warped okay we go we got logo blue light local that is actually moving you guys have no idea how hot it is in this room I am sweating I am actually dripping sweat right now come on come on a believe in you man seen this issue before where a board started lagging or something I can't remember when I had this kind of issue doing some kind of repair on something that I had and pressure was causing the board or something to go wrong and this and we saw here reminded me much more of that and here we go guys the phone is actually working check it out we have fix this phone and now we have life the phone is on we are moving a screen and it is not laggy it's working now this is just crazy all right it's not crazy I've done this much multiple times but how long it'll stay like that who knows I don't know I don't care we got my files out of there but that said I do have apps on there that I should remove with my information on it so I'll do that but first I am risking it and I should be going ahead and formatting this thing before it's too late I'm gonna go ahead and put everything back together and hopefully I can put it back together in a way where it's not gonna go crazy again what a journey I think it's been like half an hour now of recording which is pretty crazy but so yeah it looks yeah we'll just pour shut it down right there okay so what I need to do here is somehow put it back together without it bulging or anything like that if I remember correctly there are two clips that these little panels have to go between so there are clips here and inside on the other side and they have to go exactly in between them otherwise you're not gonna get a nice fit you might think it's perfect but it may not be flip it over and we're going to the down corner here get that'll slipped in nice and tidy mm-hmm that feels good now obviously I should have cleaned the chips themselves with my fingerprints on them but who cares okay now here's what I had to shoes last time putting it back in some like it was getting stuck somehow yep so see what happens here yeah there we go it fits perfectly fine back in there okay both cameras are on there this needs to clip in there yep there we go and finally the back panel now I should clean the camera now chill a bit if I do find out so I'll clean it up later okay okay here we go let's finally turn it on kay turns on put the screws back in they're still alive yep now this action camera is about to overheat and shut down I just had my hand right beside it I I just felt a wave of heat coming from it I don't know how this thing is even still on it's probably like reaching 80 degrees or something and just liking me it's pretty much overheating okay two more screws guys two more screws there we go guys we have finished fixing this thing in around what like half an hour like thirty five minutes or something I'm gonna have to cut this video down to like 10 minutes or something or something watchable insane well you guys have saw we have opened this phone up we have attempted to fix it and we have fixed it and we almost failed but we did not seem like the board was actually bending and it just caused everything to slow down pretty much we just heated the chip and what I've heard online is that the g4 was actually having solder issues which I don't think that's an issue because anyways I probably I probably just fixed the bumps and in there but that said I never really used this phone too much I never actually had it to overheat on me and shut down I haven't played games on it this thing rarely gets hot because I rarely use it and I take good care of it there's a lot of fingerprints on it but this thing is almost mid condition in some areas so yeah hope you guys have enjoyed this journey with me trying to attempt to fix my good old companion phone right here that I've used for two years probably my favorite phone so far from any phone that I've had yet and yeah we have fixed it hopefully I'll keep you guys posted if it does die again so yeah there you go if you're someone who has an LG g4 phone that died on in just like the one it did you can try this out and see if you can get it fixed that said it's a very unique problem that I had here nobody else had it other people would have a boot loop or the phone actually keeps turning on and off this one did not it would just shut off you wouldn't even get anything it just shuts off by that said it's probably something related and this is the newer models of the key four and they were manufactured so they weren't supposed to have that initial issue maybe I'm more than lucky once that you that on this one anyways guys hopefully I'll be able to use my g4 again I'm not too sure if I'm just gonna keep using this one I mean I really use this thing that I don't want to have it killed and just die off on me oh yeah this videos getting too long but yeah guys thank you all for watching hope you have enjoyed this video and found it helpful if you did hit the like button and subscribe from Cod like this and I'll see you guys in the next one and let me know if you like this new setup or this video format it's probably messy the light channel was getting all over the

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge + PLUS Teardown and Repair video",
      "transcript": "Today I’m going to show you how to take\napart the Galaxy S6 Edge +. It is the bigger and older brother to the\nGalaxy S6 Edge. To do this repair you will need a giant suction\ncup. I am just using a window mount and a heat\ngun. You will use the heat gun to take off the\nback plate. Make sure everything is turned off on the\nphone. Make sure the Sim card tray is out of the\nphone. Then heat up the back of the phone. Make sure you heat up the top the bottom and\nthe middle uniformly all the way around the outside. You want to get the phone so it’s too hot\nto touch with your fingers. What we are doing is here is that we are warming\nup the adhesive underneath the phone so that it will be easier to pry off. I grabbed my suction cup and kind of lift\nup on the center there. I put my metal pry tool in-between the glass\nand the frame. Then I can slide my playing card in-between\nthe glass and the frame so that it won’t reseal back down once I take my metal pry\ntool out. I would recommend a flat metal pry tool for\nthis. If you use something thicker like a razor\nblade it will crack the glass. I have done that before. Once you are underneath the glass make sure\nyou heat it back up again so that the adhesive is still loose. You can take your pry tool and slide it all\naround the outside and cut away the adhesive. The adhesive is you know just inside a half\ninch all the way around the edge. Now this is much harder than it looks this\nvideo is sped up to not take up too much time. So I would recommend taking your time and\nmaking sure not to crack that back glass. Especially if you are planning on using it\nafter your repair is over. Once that back is off you can see the old\nadhesive right around that back glass. I will put replacement parts down in the video\ndescription. I will do a quick camera lens replacement. So you can just put your razor blade or pry\ntool underneath that little grove and pop up the lens. The lens will come in two parts the metal\nframe and the clear glass. You can just take the clear glass from your\nreplacement lens and pop it in the metal frame. Then take that metal frame and put it back\ndown on top of the camera. Make sure there is no dust or glass shards\nin side of the camera, and make sure not to touch the inside of the camera lens. There are a bunch of screws around the inside\nof the phone. So take your Philips head screw driver. I will link all the tools in the video description\nbelow. Once the screws are out the back will just\nlift off the frame. You can see here the QI charging pad has a\nbunch of little connections that will just rest up against the mother board. Same with the side buttons, power button,\nvolume buttons, and down here for the speaker as well. They just have little contact pads that get\ntheir communication when they are pressed up against the little pins on the mother board. Here’s the battery connection I take that\noff first so that I don’t have any electricity coursing through the motherboard. There’s two wire cables down at the bottom. They are just going to unsnap, and pop off. Here’s the LCD ribbon cable. Here are the proximity sensors. Lift that up and away from the mother board. Then the mother board will lift up and fold\nup. Then there’s one more cable down there at\nthe very bottom that we are going to take off, and that is for the charging port. Now that the mother board is up we can take\noff the earpiece, the front facing camera, and the rear facing camera. All of these parts are replaceable which is\nvery nice. Except for the Sim card tray. That is soldered onto the main board. Here is a 16 Megapixel rear camera and the\n5 Megapixel front camera. Now here’s the charging port that I am fairly\ndisappointed in. You can pop up that finger print scanner and\nget that one little screw off from the charging port. Then there is the two ribbon cables as well. You think you are good to go, but you’re\nnot. There are two little wires that are holding\nthe back button and menu button and they are a pinch between the glass and plastic frame. Securely holding the charging port to the\nphone. It is irreplaceable unless you are some kind\nof wizard. Now to take the battery off the phone I am\nheating it up so I can pry it out of the plastic frame. I did not check to see if there was any pull\ntabs down at the bottom of the battery so that you can pull the adhesive out. Motorola is kind of switching to that. So before you start prying away from your\nbattery make sure there are no pull tabs down there on the bottom. Check comments. I’m sure other people will have tried this\nas well. I am taking a metal pry tool and just sliding\nit in-between the plastic frame and the battery. Make sure you don’t do any slicing motions\nthough, because you can puncture the battery making it unusable so be very careful when\nyou are prying that out from the phone. Also make sure not to bend the screen you\ndon’t want to crack the LCD on accident when you are replacing the battery. So here is the charging port that is a pinch\nfrom the plastic frame and the glass. It is pretty much irreplaceable. It is very similar to the Galaxy Note 5. You can click that video and watch how I replace\nthe charging port on that phone, but with the curved screen of the Galaxy S6 Edge plus\nI would say that it’s almost impossible to pull off the LCD from the plastic frame\nwithout breaking it. I am not going to attempt it on my phone. Between this video and my Note 5 video you\nshould be able to see everything that needs to be done in order to attempt the repair\nyourself. Go ahead and clip those cameras back into\nthe mother board. Then clip that charging port down onto the\nbase of the mother board. Here is the earpiece speaker. They are just like little Legos. Position it right above the connector and\npush it down. Here is the LCD ribbon cable and the battery. I’m plugging the battery in last just because\nwe don’t want electricity coursing through the motherboard when we are unplugging stuff. Here is the back of the phone. Just place that down and get all the screws\nback into place, and the back glass. Your replacement back glass should have adhesive\nof its own. If you are buying a new one. If you are reinstalling the old one you can\nuse double sided tape. I will link that down in the video description\nas well and you are good to go. If you have any questions make sure to leave\nthem down in the comments. Don’t forget to like if this video helped\nyou. If you did end up taking apart the phone yourself\nmake sure to leave your experience in the comments. I’m sure it will help out more people in\nthe future. Thanks a ton for watching and check out some\nof my other videos. Hope to see you around.",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge + PLUS Teardown and Repair video",
      "transcript": "Today I’m going to show you how to take\napart the Galaxy S6 Edge +. It is the bigger and older brother to the\nGalaxy S6 Edge. To do this repair you will need a giant suction\ncup. I am just using a window mount and a heat\ngun. You will use the heat gun to take off the\nback plate. Make sure everything is turned off on the\nphone. Make sure the Sim card tray is out of the\nphone. Then heat up the back of the phone. Make sure you heat up the top the bottom and\nthe middle uniformly all the way around the outside. You want to get the phone so it’s too hot\nto touch with your fingers. What we are doing is here is that we are warming\nup the adhesive underneath the phone so that it will be easier to pry off. I grabbed my suction cup and kind of lift\nup on the center there. I put my metal pry tool in-between the glass\nand the frame. Then I can slide my playing card in-between\nthe glass and the frame so that it won’t reseal back down once I take my metal pry\ntool out. I would recommend a flat metal pry tool for\nthis. If you use something thicker like a razor\nblade it will crack the glass. I have done that before. Once you are underneath the glass make sure\nyou heat it back up again so that the adhesive is still loose. You can take your pry tool and slide it all\naround the outside and cut away the adhesive. The adhesive is you know just inside a half\ninch all the way around the edge. Now this is much harder than it looks this\nvideo is sped up to not take up too much time. So I would recommend taking your time and\nmaking sure not to crack that back glass. Especially if you are planning on using it\nafter your repair is over. Once that back is off you can see the old\nadhesive right around that back glass. I will put replacement parts down in the video\ndescription. I will do a quick camera lens replacement. So you can just put your razor blade or pry\ntool underneath that little grove and pop up the lens. The lens will come in two parts the metal\nframe and the clear glass. You can just take the clear glass from your\nreplacement lens and pop it in the metal frame. Then take that metal frame and put it back\ndown on top of the camera. Make sure there is no dust or glass shards\nin side of the camera, and make sure not to touch the inside of the camera lens. There are a bunch of screws around the inside\nof the phone. So take your Philips head screw driver. I will link all the tools in the video description\nbelow. Once the screws are out the back will just\nlift off the frame. You can see here the QI charging pad has a\nbunch of little connections that will just rest up against the mother board. Same with the side buttons, power button,\nvolume buttons, and down here for the speaker as well. They just have little contact pads that get\ntheir communication when they are pressed up against the little pins on the mother board. Here’s the battery connection I take that\noff first so that I don’t have any electricity coursing through the motherboard. There’s two wire cables down at the bottom. They are just going to unsnap, and pop off. Here’s the LCD ribbon cable. Here are the proximity sensors. Lift that up and away from the mother board. Then the mother board will lift up and fold\nup. Then there’s one more cable down there at\nthe very bottom that we are going to take off, and that is for the charging port. Now that the mother board is up we can take\noff the earpiece, the front facing camera, and the rear facing camera. All of these parts are replaceable which is\nvery nice. Except for the Sim card tray. That is soldered onto the main board. Here is a 16 Megapixel rear camera and the\n5 Megapixel front camera. Now here’s the charging port that I am fairly\ndisappointed in. You can pop up that finger print scanner and\nget that one little screw off from the charging port. Then there is the two ribbon cables as well. You think you are good to go, but you’re\nnot. There are two little wires that are holding\nthe back button and menu button and they are a pinch between the glass and plastic frame. Securely holding the charging port to the\nphone. It is irreplaceable unless you are some kind\nof wizard. Now to take the battery off the phone I am\nheating it up so I can pry it out of the plastic frame. I did not check to see if there was any pull\ntabs down at the bottom of the battery so that you can pull the adhesive out. Motorola is kind of switching to that. So before you start prying away from your\nbattery make sure there are no pull tabs down there on the bottom. Check comments. I’m sure other people will have tried this\nas well. I am taking a metal pry tool and just sliding\nit in-between the plastic frame and the battery. Make sure you don’t do any slicing motions\nthough, because you can puncture the battery making it unusable so be very careful when\nyou are prying that out from the phone. Also make sure not to bend the screen you\ndon’t want to crack the LCD on accident when you are replacing the battery. So here is the charging port that is a pinch\nfrom the plastic frame and the glass. It is pretty much irreplaceable. It is very similar to the Galaxy Note 5. You can click that video and watch how I replace\nthe charging port on that phone, but with the curved screen of the Galaxy S6 Edge plus\nI would say that it’s almost impossible to pull off the LCD from the plastic frame\nwithout breaking it. I am not going to attempt it on my phone. Between this video and my Note 5 video you\nshould be able to see everything that needs to be done in order to attempt the repair\nyourself. Go ahead and clip those cameras back into\nthe mother board. Then clip that charging port down onto the\nbase of the mother board. Here is the earpiece speaker. They are just like little Legos. Position it right above the connector and\npush it down. Here is the LCD ribbon cable and the battery. I’m plugging the battery in last just because\nwe don’t want electricity coursing through the motherboard when we are unplugging stuff. Here is the back of the phone. Just place that down and get all the screws\nback into place, and the back glass. Your replacement back glass should have adhesive\nof its own. If you are buying a new one. If you are reinstalling the old one you can\nuse double sided tape. I will link that down in the video description\nas well and you are good to go. If you have any questions make sure to leave\nthem down in the comments. Don’t forget to like if this video helped\nyou. If you did end up taking apart the phone yourself\nmake sure to leave your experience in the comments. I’m sure it will help out more people in\nthe future. Thanks a ton for watching and check out some\nof my other videos. Hope to see you around.",

      "transcript": "hi this is Anna and you're watching the HTC1 M9 disassembly if you'd also like to watch the HTC1 M8 disassembly you could click on the video right here hi guys we're here with the HTC1 M9 and before you begin first thing you have to do is remove the SIM card slot and the memory expansion slot on either side of the phone which I've already done and then on this year's model compared to last they changed the design a little bit so last year's model you remove the top and bottom speaker grill covers uh this year they've incorporated into like a one design around the screen it's a one piece and uh how you remove it you're going to get your plastic preferably pry tool so you don't damage the the phone and you're going to work your way around the edges where the power button and the volume buttons are and you're going to lift you're going to push in and lift up so it has clamps all around and we're going to remove the top it separates from the middle part of the housing so let's work our way okay so now once you work your way around the edges on the sides and on the bottom let me give you a closer look you're just going to loosen it up a bit you'll see it lift up a little bit but it's not going to come up all the way it's not going to completely come off what you're going to have to do next is once you made some room to be able to pull the top black cover over the phone off it has some adhesive underneath it you're going to gently pull it off comes off just like that and you have two screws underneath here on the top of the phone one here and one on this other Corner we're going to have to remove those and these by the way they're going to be T4 screws so Torx Torx 4 remove those okay now you can work your way to the top there you go the back comes off just like that I'm going to hold this for you guys to see a little bit okay all right so when we take a look on the inside we have the camera over here and then your battery connector is going to be right here on the bottom it has two screws on it and again with HTC always on the inside is just a mess it's always so many wires going so many places I don't know why don't they don't simplify their design on the inside but let's go ahead and take it apart I'm going to remove these protective stickers that are covering the connectors lift up like white tab connectors that lock into place those white tabs right here just press up close up and then pull out the cable gently and then we're going to pop these connectors up the blue and the white now there's two philli screws that are holding the battery connector take those off and pop off the battery connector right there another white tab over here a small one pop up then you can remove this bottom cable one there and we have one here we're going to remove this gray sticker that's going over it should be careful you don't cut the cables underneath it when you're moving it small black connector right here too move that a couple more T4 screws on the inside on top when I remove these are the two silver ones by the camera and then you have four black ones on the edges of it now they're going to lift up the vibrator off the frame of the phone because soldered onto the board and then you have few more few more connectors over here going to have to work on I'm going put this on black background so you can see this is going to be your water damage sticker your water damage indicator This Is by The Flash the L flash now you're going to remove these two silver connectors you're going to pop them up one and two and on these ends too it's one and two so now there's a cable underneath it it's attached to the top board you're going to pop it up and then as you can see these come loose underneath that there's one more cable attached to the top Corner remove the protector sticker on top of it and then pop the tab open and gently pull the cable out that corner right there okay so you're going to remove this lift up this rubber cover that's by the charger port that's covering one of the cables going through it not the charger by the vibrator I'm sorry and then you're going to go to the bottom of the phone there's one T4 screw there right by the charger port not the two black ones but the silver one on top moove the protector sticker over it and then remove that screw that's holding the main board down and there's adhesive underneath the board toward the bottom just put a small Flathead under need to carefully or better use a plastic pryle to make some Leverage and then gently remove your main board so that's the main board that's underneath it and now you're left with the battery the main camera the front facing camera the top board your charger port your frame and your LCD pretty much so now let's work our way through you now have three black T4 srews on the bottom to remove and up pull up on the speaker assembly right here and this is your bottom speaker here's your charger port and your headphone jack is also on the charger port board so those two would be replaceable individually say if your charger Proco bad you have this cable it's a little flimsy as you can see it's just held on by tape that cable connects your board your main board I should say to the top board so we're just going to leave that on for now it's going to be connected to the top board top board just going to remove this now what we're going to have to do is remove the volume and the power buttons they're held on with adhesive so work your way gently underneath them to lift them up off the frame be careful not to cut it okay so once that pops up okay you're going to have two tabs on the top just push them in and away so they'll just pop off the tops holding it down and then there's one tab by the main camera over here black tab just work that silver area off it and then you're going to lift the board from the left side and this is going to be the bottom of it on the top board you're going to put a flathead underneath this silver piece it's h on by so just work it off and it's going to separate from the frame this so it doesn't focus on that so we got this we have your main camera right here and your front-facing camera right here now you're left with your top speaker the frame and the battery now for the battery it's going to be the same you're just going to have to heat it up just a little bit with either a i' s I suggest a blow dryer not a heat gun because with the heat gun you might just overdo it and ruin the battery but uh just heat it up just a little bit and then you could stick a plastic pry tool underneath from the sides and just work your way pry the battery up but I'm not going to do that there's no need to it's pretty much all that's left and then in order to remove the LCD say you break the LCD you're going to heat it up from the front also and the back there's adhesive so you'd separate the LCD from the front of the frame on the sides you would work your way around and then you'd lift the LCD up away from the frame and then You' pop on your new LCD frame but remember first you're going to have to remove the battery because all the connectors for the LCD screen and so forth are underneath it so you'd have to remove those to get to it so here's one more look before we assemble the phone these are going to be on the underneath the battery okay all right let's put the top back on top board pop on your top two tabs P back your main camera um um your top front-facing camera and then your main camera working back into its Tab and it's slot so it's nice and Thug we're going to go ahead and put this small connector right here back in and close the top to lock it close that tab to lock it in place and then put the protective sticker back on it next what we're going to do is we're going to reconnect this cable connector under right next to the camera it's going to be when you're when you're facing it's going to be to the left side of the camera so you're going to connect that connector back onto the top board to make the connection between the main board later on okay going put the charger port and headphone jack back on for for we're going to put the bottom speaker back on clicks back into place now to putting the main board back on work your way around the connector is make sure they're not stuck underneath this one connect on the top left the big one part of it goes underneath so only that one you can put underneath it make sure the rest are over the board and then we're going to put that first connector in because it's going to be hard to put it in later just make sure you put that one in first the top left connector the big one that rubber cover over the board okay so now want your other board in place press down on the bottom to restick the adhesive on the bottom that was holding the board in place and then going to put the T4 screw back in and this is the silver color SC going put that protective sticker over the screw next we're going to connect this small tab that goes for the speaker or small uh cable I mean and then put it in the connector press down on the white tab to lock it in place and now we can put the protector sticker over there that okay now I can work one by one putting these connectors back onto the main board make sure the white Tabs are open so the connectors go in and then you can lock them in place okay you're going to pop this black cable connector here's what we have so far I'm going to put the vibrator back in place push it in now we're going to put this two silver cable connectors back on to the top board and the main board okay now we're going to put the top four black T4 screws back on these well on the outer corners of the top board now put the water sticker back on go by the LED flash and put the silver sticker back over it covering these bottom cables so also has some like some sort of shield and put the last protector sticker over the last cable now we're going to put the two remaining T4 screws the silver color ones these are somewhat longer on top of the main board now that we're sure everything's in place okay now before you connect the battery always connect the battery at the end because you don't want to possibly short anything out when you touching it connect those last two cable connectors to and the silver one that go by the battery connector then last but not Le the battery connector pop that in place then you're going to put the two Phillips screws that are silver and color to hold the connector down and you're pretty much done all that's left is to put the back cover on and the top plastic cover piece so you're going to put the bottom in first slide down into place make sure your volume and power button are back in place and just pop back in the tabs and then you're going to put your top T4 screws in they're black and color put the Black cover over you're going to put the outsides in first so it's going to be kind of concave just put the outsides in first and then click into place press down so the adhesive holds and it reapplies itself and you're done I can power back on the phone thanks for watching guys please

      "title": "Nexus 6 Screen Repair, Battery Swap, Charging port fix",
      "transcript": "Today I’m going to show you how to take\napart and fix everything on the Motorola Nexus 6. To start off go ahead and turn your phone\ncompletely off. And then grab your little SIM card removal\ntool and remove that SIM card from the top of the phone. Just pressing even a little paper clip down\nin that little hole will release the SIM card. Use the same tool and press through the little\nhole in the SIM card slot to the back of the phone to remove the back cover from the phone. When you push it through it leaves a little\ngap you can slide a razor blade or maybe like a playing card, and you can use that to separate\nthe adhesive from the back plate of the phone from the phone body itself. Pretty straight forward. Just pull off the rest of the phone back. You can push like a little pry tool in-between\nthose as well. And then set that off to the side. Try not to damage it because you do need it\nfor later. Remove the little rubber casing off the battery\nconnector and then you can unplug the battery right here. If your phone is acting up sometimes unplugging\nthe battery and leaving it unplugged for 30 seconds and then plugging it back in will\nfix it. So keep that in mind when you’re working\non your phone. This is for the volume buttons. It’s a little ribbon cable you can undo\nthis little latch right here and slip out the ribbon cable. And for the rest of the phone there is a T4\ntorques head screw, 22 of them actually, and they are all around the outside of the phone. Once the screws are all taken out you can\nrelease the front of the phone from the back of the phone. The front of the phone has the motherboard\nand screen. The back of the phone has the battery and\nthe Qi charger. You can grab that little pull tab and the\nbattery will pull away from the phone. Be careful with the Qi charger, that little\nribbon cable up at the top is in the back of the frame pretty well. So make sure to separate that before you do\nany heavy pulling. And then you can remove the Qi charger from\nthe back of the battery. If you’re charging port is broken, unfortunately\nit’s not user replaceable on this phone. But you can use the wireless charging pad. I will link those in the video description\nas well along with replacement batteries if I can find them. Here’s the headphone jack; pretty easy to\npop out of the phone. Once again all parts and tools will be found\nin the video description below. Here is the magnetic ear piece. You can go ahead and pop that back into place\nas well. And here are the volume rockers. The screw you left in at the beginning is\nhow you replace those. You just pull that screw out and then the\nbuttons will fall out as well. There’s one more screw holding the motherboard\nin…same size as all the rest of the other ones. And now I’m just removing the yellow tape\nfrom the top of the ribbon cable connections. To remove these connections you just lift\nup a little tab and then you can slide the ribbon cable out from the slot and lift it\noff the main board. Same with this other one, lift up the little\nlocking lever, slip out the ribbon cable and pull it away from the motherboard. And then you can pull the motherboard away\nfrom the frame of the screen. Here’s the motherboard. Not a whole lot can be replaced on this. The SIM card slot is soldered onto the board. The front facing camera can be replaced. I will try to find replacement parts and link\nthose in the video description. Getting rid of that yellow tape, unlatching\nthe rear facing camera. It’s a 13 megapixel camera. Going to tuck that back into place as well. Tab it down and then latch it back in. Pretty easy to replace the rear camera as\nwell. So here’s the screen. If your screen is broken, like the glass is\nbroken or the LCD is broken, this is the part that you need to buy in order to replace and\nfix your phone. You might need to transfer over this metal\nplate to your new screen as well. But this is the part. If the screen you buy does not have those\nribbon cables or the front glass or the LCD, you bought the wrong part and you need to\ncheck in the video description below for this part. Doing a glass only repair is extremely extremely\ndifficult and we’re not going to cover that in this video. Get the motherboard back into place and get\nthe ribbon cables back in. We’re just putting the phone back together\nagain now. Latch it down to protect that ribbon cable\nand put the tape over the top of it to keep the latch secure. Same thing with this ribbon cable over here;\ntuck it in and make sure it’s in as far as possible and latch it down. And then get the yellow tape and put it over\nthe top of all of these ribbon cable connections that you’ve undone. Pretty simple. Get that one screw and the little metal drop\nbracket back into place at the top of the motherboard. And the motherboard has two little latches\nas well. So make sure that it’s tucked down into\nthat frame. Now with the Qi charger, I put this in first\nbefore the battery, making sure that the top of the Qi is lined up with the little slot\nthat it’s in. There’s a little pin in that frame that\nthe ribbon cable sits in. And then you line the top of the Qi up with\nthe frame and there are two holes in the Qi charger as well that you line up with the\nback of it just to make sure it’s in the perfect spot. If it’s not in the perfect spot you will\nnot be able to charge your phone. So it’s super important that it’s lined\nup exactly where it needs to be. Same thing with that little ribbon cable right\nthere. It’s going to line up on the motherboard\nand I’m going to show you that after I’m done with the volume rocker cables. So that’s where it touches on the main board. So when you’re putting your phone back together\nagain make sure those line up. Press it down all the way. It should click in fairly easily. If you’re having problems with it closing,\nit might be that your motherboard didn’t get latched into the back or front screen\nframe very well. Get that battery clipped back in. Make sure it’s really secure. And then I’m testing my phone to make sure\nit turns on before I finish putting in those 22 screws, and making sure that it charges\nup and that I have everything in the correct spot with the Qi charger. Everything’s looking good so I’m going\nto turn the phone back off again. And then 22 screws. Get all those babies back in there. Get the rubber protectors over your ribbon\ncables, volume and power. And then your back plate, if it doesn’t\nhave enough adhesive to stick down by itself, which it should unless you’ve done this\na couple times, you can use that double sided tape that I showed you to put around the edge\nand then clip it down again. Get that SIM card back in there and you should\nbe good to go. If you have any questions leave them in the\ncomments down below. Don’t forget to “like” if this video\nhelped you and don’t forget to subscribe. Hope to see you around and thanks for watching.",

      "title": "iPhone 6 Plus Screen Repair Shown in 5 Minutes",
      "transcript": "Today I’m going to show you how to replace\nthe screen on the iPhone 6+. If you want to see any of the other repairs go ahead and\nclick the links on the front menu. Here’s the iPhone 6+. With the giant screen it is\nprone to breakage. So what we’re going to go ahead and do is take out the bottom two\nscrews. They are the Pentalobe screws, the same screws that are in all the other iPhones.\nIf you need any tools or parts, check the video description. I’ll have everything\nlinked down there. Take your suction cup and lift up on the screen and that will allow\nyou to slip your pry tool in between the screen and the frame of the phone. Pry up very gently\nbecause you don’t want to damage the screen any more than it is. And then you’ll be\nable to lift the screen up. Don’t lift it past 90 degrees or you’ll put stress on\nthe ribbing cables that are underneath this metal plate. Take off the five screws. Then\nyou can remove the metal plate. And then each of these little ribbing cables is kind of\nlike a LEGO. You just unsnap them from its little connector and then lift it up. There’s\nfour little connectors underneath here. Now if the four connectors are done, the screen\ncomes up, and your replacement screen probably won’t come with the hardware, so I’m going\nto show you how to transfer all that to the new screen. Start with the earpiece. There’s\nthree screws on the metal bracket. Lift that up. Then you can grab your earpiece out. Once\nagain, replacement parts are in the video description. And then you’ll probably need\nto move over the replacement parts as well. They’re glued down so just unsnap those\nfrom the old screen. And then you can lift off the ribbing cable contraption. This will\nalso be linked down in the video description below so if your proximity sensor or your\ncamera is messed up, go ahead and check that out. There’s two screws holding down the\nhome button. Remove that bracket. And then there’s one more of those little ribbing\ncable connectors right here so just unsnap that. And then you can press the home button\nout from the front of the phone. Lift up the little circuit board as well. Make sure not\nto put any stress on the ribbing cable at all or else your fingerprint scanner won’t\nwork when you install it again. There’s the home button and fingerprint scanner. There’s\na bunch of screws around the outside edge of the metal plate so go ahead and undo those.\nAnd the bottom ribbing cable is still glued to the frame so make sure you pry that up\nvery gently and then the metal backing will come away from the screen. There it is, along\nwith the fingerprint scanner. And then you can transfer all those parts over to your\nnew screen and once again these are linked down in the video description below so if\nyou need to buy a new one check there. Place that metal bracket back down on the phone\nagain over the little ribbon flap that’s underneath the earpiece. Make sure it’s\non top. Get all the screws back in along the sides. Now let’s get the home button in\nplace. Just press it down. The glue that was on it before should still be sticky so it\nshould just stick right down in there how it was. Clip that ribbing cable. You’ll\nkind of feel a little snap in place just like a LEGO. Put the two screws on the bracket\nback in. Pretty straightforward. Now with the earpiece section, you want to get that\nlittle bracket in place. Once you get the ribbing cable on top of it it’ll hold the\nplastic better than it is right now. Fold each part individually. Place it exactly where\nit needs to go. It’s kind of like a puzzle so if each part isn’t exactly where it needs\nto be it’s not going to fit very smoothly. Slide the earpiece in between the cables because\nthe top part of the cables have the connections that make the earpiece work. Get the camera\ndown in the little plastic hole and then the metal bracket goes right over the top. It\nshould fit very easily, lining up very easily with the holes. If it’s not fitting easily,\nyou should probably lift it up and make sure everything’s positioned correctly. Now that\nall our parts are on the new screen, we ca go ahead and clip it back in. Once again,\nyou’ve got to be really careful with these cables. You don’t want to bend any of the\nconnections. So make sure you position it directly over the connection and then press\ndown and you’ll feel it snap in with your fingers. I keep on referencing LEGOs because\nthat’s exactly how it is. Now if your screen has lines through it when you turn it back\non there’s a chance that one of these ribbon cables didn’t get snapped on correctly.\nSo turn your phone off and then lift up the screen again and make sure each of the connections\nare good. I mean there’s a chance that your screen is bad but check the connections first.\nThe connections are good on this one so now I can go ahead and put that metal bracket\non. I’m turning the phone off first because you don’t want to work on it at all while\nthe phone is on. Now the metal bracket with the five screws, get that back into place.\nAnd the top of the phone has these little grooves that you want to slide into the frame.\nGet that first, and then you can press down along the edges, snapping each of those little\nthings back into place as well. Remember, don’t use a lot of force or you’re going\nto break your new screen and that is not the direction you want to go. Once your screen\nis snapped in, you can turn it on, make sure the bottom two Pentalobe screws are in, and\nyou are set. Thanks a ton for watching. The best thing you can do for me is just subscribe\nto my YouTube channel. I do put up videos fairly often and it does mean a lot to me.\nThanks a ton for watching. If you have any questions go ahead and leave them in the comments\nbelow. I do respond fairly regularly, and feel free to check out my Instagram. I think\nit’s pretty fun.",

flat-head screwdriver plastic opening tools suction cup a spudger iphone 5-point pentalobe screwdriver sim card ejection tool fine-tipped curved tweezers a heat gun or a blow dryer let's go ahead and get started here with our iPhone 6 plus before we start any part of our disassemble we want to power the unit off first and then we can start by removing the two pentalobe screws one on either side of the Lightning port down by the home button you with our pentalobe screws removed we can bring in our suction cup and use that on the front of our display closer to the home button so we can take a grip of either side of the iPhone and begin pulling our display assembly away from the base of the phone the aid of your fingernail or possibly a plastic opening tool might assist separating the display assembly from the iPhone with the display peeled up you're gonna notice of metal protective plates that's covering the four connections for our display assembly let's remove the five Phillips screws that are securing this plate so we can get to those connections our tweezers is gonna make short work with these wafer plugs disconnecting them and completely separating our display assembly from the base of our phone let's now break down the components of our display assembly starting with our earpiece speaker and front-facing camera that's secured with a metal backplate here at the top of the display removing the three Phillips screws and then peeling away the front-facing camera releasing our earpiece speaker first and then carefully manoeuvring the rest of our front-facing camera assembly away from the display our home buttons next secure here at the bottom of the phone with a metal backplate you lcd backplates gonna be next secured with eight Phillips screws one on either side of the display and then three on each of the sides of the display let's carefully remove these screws and before completely removing the backplate let's carefully peel up the wafer connection here for our home button as it's secured with a little bit of adhesive before lifting the backplate away from the display assembly you and with the iPhone six-plus the batteries used to be equipped with pull tabs at the bottom of the battery to assist with the removal of the adhesive releasing the battery from the phone we've previously used our pull tabs to remove the battery already and reinstalled ours with adhesive strips we're gonna show you to heat up the adhesive strips to soften up the adhesive and then use a pry tool or the flat side of our spudger to release the battery from our phone use a SIM card removal tool or a paper clip to pull the SIM card tray out of the side of the phone and now let's remove our rear facing camera two Phillips screws one on either side of the cameras backplate you in the other top corner we have a backplate here for the two connections for our power and volume buttons let's remove these two Phillips screws and pull that back plate from the phone carefully the release the two connections from the motherboard and then remove the three Phillips screws that are securing the antenna in the top left corner the antenna has a coaxial connection that runs the length of the motherboard if you disconnect the coaxial plug the antenna should lift easily from the phone let's release our wafer connection down here for our dock port assembly and then the coaxial plug right next to it we have three Phillips screws here helping secure the vibration motor next to the loudspeaker once removed the vibration motor should be easily maneuvered from the phone you with all connections and screws removed you can slowly bring the motherboard up from the iPhone but not completely removing it there is a small connection on the bottom of the motherboard for an antenna that's still locked in the phone be sure to disconnect this coaxial connection before removing the motherboard completely you let's keep track of the metal bracket that is secured right on the back of the Lightning port for our reassembly and you're gonna notice we're gonna use a heat gun or a blow-dryer to assist softening up the adhesive making maneuvering disassembly much easier out of the phone we've got a small antenna here that's secured into the top of our phones single Phillips screw and thus antenna is easily removed let's remove our volume buttons we've got three Phillips screws that are securing it into the side of the phone and again with a little bit of heat softening up the adhesive making peeling up the ribbon cable much easier let's come over here to our power button assembly we've got two Phillips screws that are securing the assembly into the side of the phone and then a third Phillips screw on the backplate for our our camera flash carefully peel up the ribbon wire and the assembly is removed you next we'll bring in our dock port which is a little difficult to maneuver let's start over here with the headphone jack assembly positioning that in first then followed by our lightning port lining that up right into the center and then securing and lining up the rest of the holes accordingly let's not forget the metal bracket that goes just behind the Lightning port connector before we secure it completely with all 11 screws next we want to bring the loudspeaker into the bottom corner let's start by securing it with the just this one single screw you the next securing screw is going to require a metal bracket where the coaxial cable runs through you and we can now begin securing our motherboard starting first with a Phillips screw here by the SIM card tray how about our two standoffs here in the center of the motherboard let's remember we need a flathead screwdriver to bring these in another Philips screw just to the left of the back plate for the camera flash that little strap that we didn't want to lose that was just to the right of our rear facing camera let's bring that into position and secure it with a single Phillips screw on the bottom of the strap you be sure that we put in place the metal bracket here for our coaxial connection aligning up our screws as well for the vibration motor and make sure that we don't pinch the wire for the coaxial connection while doing so once it's all in place we can secure it with two Phillips screws let's secure our wafer connection into the motherboard for the dock port as well as the coaxial connection that's right next to it let's bring in our other antenna into the top left-hand corner of the phone running its coaxial connection the length of the motherboard securing it down on to its plug near the standoff and then the three Phillips screws that are going to secure the antenna into place if you haven't already done so let's secure the connections for your power and volume buttons so that we can reinstall the metal backplate with the two Phillips screws over top of it let's drop in our rear-facing camera into the housing and secure the way for connection positioning the strap before we bring in the backplate for the camera securing it down with two Phillips screws next we want to bring our battery back down into the phone if you haven't already done so please suggest installing some adhesive strips to secure the battery into place you eight screws in total one on either side one down by the home button as well as the earpiece speaker and then three down each side of the LCD before bringing our home button in we can reposition the way for connection into its housing and then properly position the home button down into place securing that way for connection and then reinstalling the backplate with the two Phillips screws to secure it our front-facing camera an earpiece speaker are going to be next you reinstall it onto the face of our phone positioning our connectors into place and carefully but firmly locking our connections down into our motherboard with all four of our connections secured we can now bring in the protective plate over top securing it with the five Phillips screws and now bring the display assembly down to the phone starting at the top towards the earpiece speaker you'll notice a series of hooks that we need to hook into the top lip of the phone base before bringing the rest of the screen down flush with the phone once you're completely flush all the way down to the bottom towards the home button we can now reinstall our two pentalobe screws one on either side of the Lightning port at this point we're gonna want to power it on and check for full functionality all of the parts and

      "title": "iPhone 6 Plus Charging Port Replacement shown in 6 Minutes",
      "transcript": "Today I’m going to show you how to replace\nthe charging port in your iPhone 6 Plus. If you want to check out any of the other\nrepair videos click on the links on the front of this video. Here’s the iPhone 6 Plus. To get to the charging port we have to go\nthrough the screen. So we’re going to remove the two screws\nat the bottom called pentalobe screws. If you need any tools or replacement parts,\ncheck in the video description below, I will link everything for you there. Take your suction cup and put it on the screen\nand lift up a little bit. Then you can take your pry tool and lift up\non the frame of the glass and pry against the frame of the phone and that will lift\nthe screen off. Be super careful because the screens are very\nfragile and you don’t want to bend it or it will crack. Don’t bend the screen past 90 degrees because\nthese ribbon cables will get stressed. Take out the 5 screws. Remove the metal plate. And then pop up each of these little ribbon\ncables. There are four of them and you can kind of\ntreat them like Legos; they just unsnap from the motherboard. Once you’ve unsnapped all four the screen\nwill come loose. You can see all the components there: the\nearpiece…the home button. Set that aside somewhere safe. Then there are three screws next to the battery. Undo all three of those and pop off the little\nmetal bracket. Then unclip the battery from the motherboard. Then there’s a ribbon cable right here that’s\nhiding another screw, so lift that up and then unscrew that screw. Set it aside. And make sure you stay organized with these\nscrews; that’s super important. Unsnap the wire cable and then the vibrator\nmotor will slip out from underneath that ribbon cable. Pull the wire cable from the vibrator motor. Then you can see here that the two contact\npoints are where it goes on the ribbon cable for the charging port. Anyway, pull out the wire cable. Two more screws down at the bottom of the\nloud speaker. Undo those; set them aside. Keep them organized. And then the loud speaker will come out from\nthe phone as well. So this is what plays your music and your\nring tone and stuff like that. You can clean it out if there are ever any\nmetal shavings stuck inside it because there’s a big magnet. There are two contact points that connect\nto the ribbon cable down at the bottom. Then there’s a little square metal bracket. Put that somewhere safe. Two screws holding the shield down for the\ncharging port; undo that. Set that aside next to the two screws that\nyou just took out. Then there are five more screws. The blue one is for the microphone, the little\nbracket that holds that in place. This little guy. Set that next to the screw you took out. Two screws down for the headphone jack and\ntwo screws on the other side of the phone as well. Keep those organized and then lift off the\nwire cable as well. You’ll need to move that to your new charging\nport. Then you can kind of use a plastic tool and\nscrape underneath the ribbon cable for the charging port and lift that out of the phone. You want to be pretty careful with it just\nin case your new charging port doesn’t work you can put your old one in for the time being. Lift that out and be super careful with the\nheadphone jack and the microphone. They are kind of embedded in the frame of\nthe phone. Once you’ve lifted those out from the frame,\nyou get the charging port itself. Now there might be a little rubber boot on\nthe end of the microphone that you need to transfer over to your new one. It just depends on if your new charging port\ncomes with that or not. So make sure you’ve transferred over everything\nthat needs to be transferred over. Pop the headphone jack back into the frame\nof the phone. Same with the microphone; just kind of press\nit in there. Make sure the hole lines up with the hole\nin the frame. Then you can take the microphone bracket;\nslip that back into place. If you need to pause it here you can. Make sure all these screws go back into the\nsame holes they came out of. The wire cable goes down on the little connection. Just line it over the top and press it in. Get that shield back on there with the two\nscrews. Once that’s done you can get the loud speaker….I’ve\nalready put the little square metal bit, attached it to it, and then the wire cable goes underneath\nin that little groove. Once you’ve positioned all that you can\nscrew in the little screw at the corner of the battery and then the other screw down\nat the other corner of the phone on the loud speaker. Clip the wire cable into the vibrator motor. Get that hidden screw back in place. Clip down the ribbon cable. Clip down the wire cable; press it right down\non top of the connection. And then you can clip down the battery. Pretty straight forward. Get the top clip on there and then get the\nother two screws and also the screw down at the bottom of the vibrator motor. A lot of steps to remember. Here’s the screen, and then there are four\nlittle connections that go right back onto the motherboard. Remember we’re treating them like Legos;\nso line them up right over the connection and then press them down into place. Pretty straight forward. If you end up with lines in your screen that\nmeans one of these connections wasn’t pressed down correctly. So turn off your phone again, pop off the\nscreen, and make sure they are all pressed down correctly. You want to make sure you do it right. I actually…once I get the all pressed down,\nI turn on the phone before I actually close my screen down so I don’t have to risk breaking\nthe screen as I pull it off again. So you can see the screen is still up. Everything is working fine; no lines. Turn the phone off because you definitely\ndon’t want to be working on it while the phone is on. That was just to test the screen. Anyway get the little metal bracket back on\nthere with those five screws. Then you want to line the top of the screen\nup with the frame on the phone; just kind of press it in so it’s flush. And then once that’s in you can line the\nrest of the phone up with the screen and just kind of clip it down. Remember to be super gentle with it because\nyou don’t want to break your screen. The more gentle you are the better. Just be super careful. I will link all of the replacement parts and\ntools in the video description below. Get those two bottom screws in there after\nyou turn the phone back on. And you’re set. If you have any questions make sure to leave\nthem in the comments. Feel free to “like” this video if it helped\nyou and don’t forget to subscribe. It does mean a lot to me. Thanks for watching!",

      "title": "iPhone 6 Plus Battery Replacement in 4 Minutes",
      "transcript": "In this video I’m going to show you how\nto remove the battery in the iPhone 6 Plus. If you want to watch any of the other repair\nvideos go ahead and click the link in the front of this one. Here’s the iPhone 6 Plus. In order to get to the battery we have to\ntake off the screen. The screen is held down by two pentalobe screws\ndown at the bottom of the phone. If you need tools or replacement batteries\nI will link those in the video description. So check there if you need to buy anything. I’m going to lift up on the screen with\na suction cup and that will allow me to slip my pry tool between the screen and the frame. I want to pry up only on the frame of the\nscreen and the frame of the phone that way I don’t cause any damage to the screen because\nit is very very fragile. So be very careful with it. Don’t bend it past 90 degrees because the\nribbon cables will get stressed and we don’t want put any damage to those. Remove the 5 screws, remove the bracket, and\nthen unclasp each of these 4 ribbon cables. Be careful with them. They’re just very similar to Legos; just\nunclasp them from the motherboard. Technically you don’t have to remove the\nscreen for this repair, but getting the battery out can be sort of violent so we want to make\nsure we don’t damage the screen in the process. Remove the metal bracket and the two screws\nholding down the battery cable. Now the phone that I’m working on right\nnow has been taken apart before so I’m going to use footage from my iPhone 6 repair video\nto kind of teach you how the battery is held down by the glue. I’m warming up the phone from the back. If the phone ever gets too hot for you to\ntouch, you’ve gone too far and wait for it to cool down a little bit. You definitely don’t want to overheat the\nphone or you might cause damage. Also when you’re prying out the battery\nyou want to make sure not to use a metal tool. Try to stick with a plastic tool so you don’t\ncut the battery at all. If you end up cutting the battery it does\npose a fire hazard. It could burn you with the acid underneath. Anyways, be really careful not to break the\nblack plastic around the battery. So there is a trick that I’ve learned that\nmight help you out. There are two little tabs down at the very\nbottom of the battery that might help you lift it out of the phone. You will probably still need to warm up the\nphone to kind of loosen up the glue underneath the battery but the tabs are there to help\nyou out as well. So give that a shot. You can kind of see how much glue is underneath\nhere. It’s kind of ridiculous. Once you’ve gotten all the glue out, if\nthe glue is still stuck to the bottom of the phone you can reuse it later. If not, you want to put in some of the black\ntape. And make sure to avoid damaging the ribbon\ncables up around the top edge of the phone. Here’s the sticky tape. Putting in another strand to help hold it\ndown so it doesn’t jiggle around inside of the phone and cause any more damage. Clip the battery back into place. Get that metal bracket over the top. Get those two screws back in. And here’s the screen, be very careful as\nyou’re putting this back down. Remember treat them kind of like Legos. Line up the ribbon cable with the slot on\nthe motherboard and just put your finger over it and press down. If you end up with lines on your screen after\nyou turn the phone back on, it means that these ribbon cables aren’t seated correctly. So lift up the screen, pop off the ribbon\ncables, put them back on, reconnect them, make sure they’re clipped on good and that\nshould get rid of your lines issue. Right now the phone is on with the screen\nstill up; just making sure there are no lines or anything. Now I’m turning the phone off because you\ndefinitely don’t want to work on the phone while the screen is up. There are five more screws along the metal\nplate. Here you want to line up the top of the screen\nwith the phone. There are kind of some grooves that fit in\nthere. Once the grooves are flush with the phone,\nyou can just run your hands down the side of the phone and press the screen down in\nthe metal frame. Be really careful, this phone is gigantic\nso you could break the screen very easily by pressing the wrong place. So make sure you stay around the frame and\nbe very gentle with it. Get the bottom two screws in and you are set. If you have any questions make sure to leave\nthem in the comments below. Don’t forget to “like” if this video\nhelped you and don’t forget to subscribe, it does mean a lot to me. And feel free to check out my Instagram, I\nthink it’s pretty fun.

bringing the display assembly up with our display peeled up we're going to notice a metal protective plate in the top right hand corner that's covering our four connections for the display assembly let's remove the five philli screws that are securing this plate and then we can come in with our tweezers and gently pry up on each of the four connections completely separating the display assembly from the base the phone with our display completely removed let's go ahead and break down each of its components starting up here at the top with our earpiece speaker bracket removing the three Phillips screws that are securing it down notice we used a heat gun or a blow dryer to soften up the adhesive on the small portion of the ribbon cable for the home button before completely peeling the assembly away from the display the LCD back plate is secured with seven Phillips screws you'll have three on either side of the lcv we're then going to use our tweezers to release the connection here and originally the battery was equipped with pull tabs down towards the bottom using those pull tabs would have helped in releasing the adhesive that secures the battery into the base of the phone because we've previously removed our pull tabs and reinstalled the battery with adhesive strips we are going to heat up the adhesive with a heat gun or a blow dryer to soften up the adhesive and then use a tool or the flat side of our spudger to get under the battery and peel it up from the iPhone next you can use your sim card removal tool or a paperclip to take the SIM card tray out of the side of the phone and let's bring our attention here to the rear-facing camera in the top corner two Phillips screws secure the metal bracket for the rear-facing camera and then the single W for connection here that we can peel up from the motherboard and remove the camera let's go over to the other Corner we have a protective plate that's securing the connections down for our power and volume buttons we need to get out of the way two Filip screws is going to take care of this next we can pop those connections loose here with our tweezers we have four additional screws securing this antenna into the top left corner with those screws removed we can then peel out that antenna using our tweezers we have a small bracket here secured with two philli screws let's be sure that when we remove this bracket we keep track of it as it is very small and it is going to be difficult to remember where it goes upon reassembly let's work towards removing our motherboard now we have two philli screws up here near the rear-facing camera we have a standoff in the middle of the motherboard that we want to remove using a flat tip screwdriver we have a wafer plug down here near the bottom of the motherboard for the dock Port connector and then right next to it is a CO axle connection that we need to peel up a Philips screw down here near the SIM card tray so our dock port and headphone jack assembly is going to be next secured with nine philli screws we can go ahead and remove let's be sure to keep track of the bracket that's tied on to the back of the lightning Port connector for our reassembly we're going to use a heat gun or a blow dryer to soften up the adhesive to make maneuvering the assembly out of the bottom of the phone a little easier let's bring our attention now to the power button and camera flash assembly secured with three Phillips screws into the side of the phone position ing the camera flash into its housing properly snapping it down into place and positioning the power button into the side of the phone and securing it with its three philli screws and position them into the side of the phone as well and secure them as well with three philli screws next position the back plate for the camera flash you're only going to want to secure this with the single Phillips screw down at the bottom next we have our dock Port maneuvering the dock Port back into place is a little tricky you want to start on the headphone jack assembly side first and get that positioned properly and then work your way towards the center the lightning port and then properly press down on the ribbon cable once the dock Port is seated you can position the bracket that's just behind the lightning Port connector and then secure the entire assembly with the nine Phillips screws let's now maneuver the motherboard back into place working our way around the ribbon cables we can begin securing it with the Philips screw down here by the SIM card tray first remember our other little grounding strap let's not forget to position it into place and secure it with the two Phillips screws one on the frame of the phone and then one down into the motherboard we can now reinstall our antenna let's secure it with the four Phillips screws positioning our co- axle connection plug into place and locking it down into the motherboard and then connecting our wafer connection for the dock Port assembly next we drop our vibration motor back down into place and secure it with the two filp screws and let's now reinstall our battery let's now reassemble our display assembly starting with our home button positioning it into place first next we want to bring in the LCD back plate this is going to allow us to position the connection for our home button assembly and then we want to bring in the front camera assembly we can now position the front-facing camera assembly down into its housing leaving the actual front-facing camera Fold It Up Until We position the earpiece speaker into place and then run the ribbon cable over the earpiece speaker locking down the actual front-facing camera into its housing when you're positioning your display back down to the phone you want to start at the top portion of the display up by the earpiece speaker and position its top hooks into the base of the phone and then continuing to secure the display down the sides of the phone until it's flush all the way down to the bottom once the display is flush with the base of the phone you can reinstall your pentalobe screws one on either side of the lightning port install your sim card tray into the side of the phone at this point you can power it on and check for full functionality all of the parts and tools you've seen today in this video are available at www.x don't

      "title": "iPhone 6 Screen Replacement done in 5 minutes",
      "transcript": "In this video I'm going to show you how to\nreplace the screen on an iPhone 6. If you want to see any of those other repairs go\nahead and click the links. Here we have the iPhone 6. I'm going to go ahead and turn it\noff, grab my Pentalobe screwdriver, and take out the two little screws in the bottom. These\nare the same size screws as all of the other iPhones. And you can grab any tools or replacement\nparts in the video description below. I'm going to take a suction cup and lift up the\nscreen just a little bit, so I can slip a pry tool. You can use a plastic one or a metal\none if you want. Just make sure to lift up on the actual metal frame of the screen. Otherwise\nyou might crack it as you pry it up. So be super careful with that. As you lift up the\nscreen you'll see these five screws on the metal plate. Take out those screws, remove\nthe plate, and then unsnap each of these little clasps. The clasps are very similar to LEGOs.\nJust kind of take your little pry tool, pop them underneath, and they'll unclasp from\nthe little latch that they're on. Anyway this is the screen. There's a very good chance\nthat when you buy the replacement screen you're going to have to move over all the individual\nparts from one screen to the other. We're going to start with the earpiece. There's\nthree screws up at the top. Take out those screws and then the little bracket comes off.\nPut that somewhere safe. Make sure you keep all your screws really organized or you're\ngoing to have problems later. Here's the earpiece. Once again, all the parts and tools for this\nproject can be found in the video description below so go ahead and check that out. I'm\npulling up the front camera and the proximity sensor from the little brackets that they're\nheld in, and then I'm pulling off the last little bit that's taped down by the earpiece.\nThese parts are really inexpensive. At least they have been in the past with the iPhone\n5's and 4's. So go ahead and check out the video description if you want to check out\nhow much these parts are. There's three screws on both sides of the metal plate and then\none screw down at the bottom. So take those out and there's two screws that hold the home\nbutton in place. Remove that bracket. And then the home button is just lightly taped\ndown. It's just lightly stuck. So peel that up. And there's one little connector right\nthere just like the little connectors that were holding the screen down, those little\nLEGO pieces. So un-pop that and remember that this is the only home button, the one that\ncomes with your phone, that will work with the fingerprint scanner. Any other aftermarket\nhome buttons that you put on the phone will not work with the fingerprint scanner, they'll\njust work as a home button. So keep that in mind. Anyway, lift it off the metal plate.\nYou can see the ribbing cable that connects the home button up by the earpiece. And this\nis the screen. Check the video description below for replacement screens, I'll have them\nlinked down there for you. And there's a good chance you might need to move over the plastic\nbrackets from one screen to the other, so they just pop right out. And when you put\nthem back in, you don't need to worry about gluing them down or anything because the actual\nribbing cable will hold them in the correct place that they need to be. And you'll see\nthat here in a second. Anyway, I'm going to grab the earpiece ribbing cable and put that\nback in, lining it up with a little peg up at the top. It's really easy not to mess this\nup because there's little guiding pegs that the ribbing cables sit on top of. And then\neach little component has its own little slot up at the top so you can just kind of see\nwhere each little piece goes. The earpiece is going to go down over the top of the camera\nand the proximity sensor and those gold little connections points will fold right over the\ntop of the earpiece. And the camera will go in its slot. Once the camera is in there you\ncan take your back plate and slide it up over that ribbing cable for the LCD, and line it\nup with the hole and then you can grab the bracket for the camera and put it over the\ntop as well. Remember those three screws that hold that down, and then we can start with\nthe home button. It should still be relatively sticky from before. Either way, just put it\ndown in place over the hole. And then fold over that little LEGO piece and snap that\nin place just like a LEGO. And then you can grab your bracket, screw that in with the\ntwo screws. And then there's seven screws around the side of that metal plate so make\nsure those are in as well. Now we're going to take the screen and plug each of those\nlittle connectors in, there's four of them. So kind of work your way down. You'll feel\nit seat on top of the little plug, and then you can just press it down the rest of the\nway. Very similar to LEGOs. Get all four of those in and then while the screen is still\nup you can go ahead and turn your phone on just to make sure that it's working. So make\nsure that the touch sensitivity is working and the LCD is working and then turn the phone\noff before you do anything else. Put the metal bracket back into place. You got those five\nscrews. And then you can fold your screen down and press it into place. So make sure\nthat you start with the top of the screen and slide it up and into the little groove\nso that it's super flush with the edge of the phone. And then you can press the edges\nin as you go down, around, and towards the charging port. Make sure you put those bottom\ntwo Pentalobe screws in, and there you go. If you have any questions make sure to leave\nthem in the comments. Don't forget to like if this video helped you and don't forget\nto subscribe. Does mean a lot to me.

      "title": "Urgent iPhone 6 Repair - Won&#39;t power on and Customer NEEDS DATA",
      "transcript": "here we have an iPhone 6 that came in for data recovery and this one came in locally customer said that he needs data because nobody fixes an iPhone 6 just for the sake of fixing iPhone 6. you can go online and buy a used one for how much 60 70 I have not checked the past couple years I do not know how much those phones are going for but they're pretty cheap I told the customer I'll do my best and we already disassembled the board the customer mentioned one thing he said that about a year ago he went to another shop they replaced his battery and the battery has been working for the past year so battery likely has nothing to do with why the phone is not powering on right now now I already started working on this board and then I thought why not record the video let me show you what was done if you notice here I removed the plate that was soldered on the side of the board and the plate looks something like this and I also removed a piece of black cloth that sits on top here that covers the touch I see so on and so forth and I also desoldered a plate that covers the CPU right here you can tell so we did three things now what I want to do is plug in the charger and we're going to plug in the battery are we using the right one this one is six plus that's the wrong one before we proceed with this video I want to give a shout out to our sponsor PCB way PCB way is a PCB manufacturer and printed circuit board assembler with more than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and Fabrication this month PCB way is holding a competition where a user submits their PCB design for a chance to win 1500 Cash Plus 200 in coupons that can be used on the PCB way website if you have a good PCB idea click on the link below to sign up and make sure to check them out and I'm using the mechanic power supply this device has been out of stock for the past maybe a month or two we have them in stock right now and the device supports up to I believe iPhone 13 Pro Max let me show you how it looks like device looks something like this the cable is short so I'm not going to be able to go all the way up to show you we have the charging connector and the battery connected to the board using this extension cable that is supplied along with this device and I just want to show you what happens when I plug in the cable display goes off the display went out because of likely a short circuit on the board we should see an amp draw on the screen here we should see 0.30.40.5 it should go up to about 1.4 amps and then back down to about 0.4 amps if that board is working but as soon as I plug in the cable the device goes off let's unplug and we're going to unplug the cable we do have that device in stock as of today if you are a hobbyist or in the same type of business you can purchase that device of our site we do have it out of stock as of current but we should update the status Maybe by later today or tomorrow and you can buy everything that you need all from one place we have soldering stations out there stations thermal camera power supply flux tweezers voltage injection tool the amazing microscope that we use which is the best out there the anticular light all items are in stock the only thing we have out of stock as of today is the microscope articulating arm you can either wait until we get them back in stock or you can get the one from amscope so right now since the meter is going off as soon as we plug in the charging cable and Battery it tells me that we have a short circuit and that was the reason why I desoldered that plate from here we removed the black piece from here and we also desoldered the plate from here the first thing I want to do is check for a VCC short let's open up the board diagram now all the red dots that you see on the front and back side of the board are points where we can test for VCC I want to test to see if we have a short circuit on any one of those red dots so the bottom part is back of the board and the top part is front of the board now since I have the board flip to the back that's the front and that's the back let's start with the back from my experience working on iPhone 6s I know that we have a VCC point right here if we check the board diagram if you read down on the bottom PP VCC main so I want to test and see that we have a short circuit here I can also test the capacitor that's on bottom of the chip this point right here I can attach the cap that's on top let me show you what I mean red Probe on ground meter and diet mode we're gonna put a probe here and I can measure right here and look at this we have a short circuit if we go to ohms mode and we test here zero ohm zero ohm reading so we do have it that short on the VCC line let me go back to diet mode we can measure here we have a short based on the board view diagram I'm looking at we can measure here we have a short so where is the shot coming from is it coming from this cap is it coming from this cap is it coming from this cap or is it coming from any one of the components on the board that connects directly to VCC we do not know we cannot just remove components until we get to the component that is causing the problem we cannot do that the chip itself may also be causing the short if you look at the board view diagram let me show you this is back of the board let me zoom out you can tell that a lot of components on the board connect with VCC Main and any one of those components could be the culprit look if you go to the touch area right here we have more components here that connect the VCC and those are caps because one end is ground and the other end is VCC you have more caps here any one of those could be caused in the short and then if we flip the board go to front of the board same thing we do not have as many components that connect to VCC as back of the board but we do have a cap here that could be shot in the ground we could have a component here that could be shot in the ground if that component is a capacitor of course resistors do not short to ground we have an inductor here and doctor does not short the ground it's something that causes the inductor to short the ground likely a capacitor or an IC and we also have VCC right here and this one is a cap right now what we can do is we can inject voltage on any one of the red dots that you see on back of the board or front of the board and we can monitor the board under a thermal camera and see what gets hot we want to narrow down where that short is coming from let's go ahead and do it I'm gonna set my voltage injection tool to 1.4 volts if I do not see anything at 1.4 then maybe we can bump up voltage so I currently set the nf. short voltage injection tool to 1.4 volts and I'm going to connect the ground alligator clip to one of the ground paths on the board the screw hole right here and now we can inject voltage and see what gets hot on the board so look at this I see something hot right over here right there what's here let's take a look see we got it quick we injected voltage and something got hot on the bottom side of the board so if you look at the board here let me disconnect I injected voltage right on this side of the board right at the cap over the chip and something got hot right next to the touch I see let's take a look at the board and see what's in this area and we can also look at the board diagram and see what VCC components are in this area so we got the heat spot right over here based on my experience working on iPhone 6s it's almost always never this IC that is causing the short we do have two caps here connecting to VCC right below the touch I see but again from experience I never seen those caps go short and the heat spot was coming all the way from the edge from this Edge right here we do not have any components right on the edge that connects to VCC made so what I want to do is let's take a look at the front side of the board flip the board and if we flip the board the area that got hot from back of the board is right here right at the top where you see this big inductor let me zoom in so the heat spot is coming from right over here right here we see a huge inductor and this inductor does not show to ground and doctors and resistors do not short to ground if I am to take an educated guess I would go for this component or this component those are big caps and those caps can cause a short circuit and I've seen it happen before I'm using a combination of logic and experience foreign we have two caps right here and one of them could be causing the short which one let's wait until the board cools down a bit maybe we can inject voltage at any one of those two calves and we can apply isopropyl and see where alcohol boils first or evaporates first but the board is hot right now because we applied a tiny bit of hot air to scrape off the overfill so we're going to inject voltage at any one of the two caps from the bottom and let me grab some isopropyl or we can inject voltage right here and then we can apply alcohol isopropyl let's do it I'm not able to tell unless the short is not coming from here it looks like it may be number one watch how alcohol is not staying on that cap okay I think we got it this guy right here just flick off that cap meter in diet mode and let's measure right here wow no short wow we did it we do not have a shot anymore let's flip the board go back here see what we did we used logic and prior experience working on this board we took an educated guess and we got it we do not have to replace the cap we'll do data recovery and we're done let's measure here no short anymore no short anymore and no short anymore that was an amazing repair wow but let's not consider the repair done yet until we see the Apple logo phone boots and then I'll call it a repair I'll be back take boss just informed me of the good news look at this wow the phone is working and the cab that we removed and you're not gonna be able to see it but the cab that we removed was right over here see how we have one cap left wow wow amazing amazing we did it we're gonna start the backup process and then we

This month PCB way is holding a competition where a user submits their PCB design for a chance to win 1500 Cash Plus 200 in coupons. Click on the link below to sign up and make sure to check them out. cable is short so I'm not going to be able to go all the way up to show you we have the charging connector and the battery connected to the board using this extension cable that is supplied along with this device. We do have that device in stock as of today if you are a hobbyist or in the same type of business you can purchase that device of our site. tweezers voltage injection tool the amazing microscope that we use which is the best out there the anticular light all items are in stock the only thing we have out of stock as of today is the microscope articulating arm. let's start with the back from my experience working on iPhone 6s. I know that we have a VCC point right here if we check the board diagram if you read down on the bottom PP VCC main. I can also test the capacitor that's on bottom of the chip. Let me show you what I mean red Probe on ground meter and diet mode. components until we get to the component that is causing the problem we cannot do that the chip itself may also be causing the short if you look at the board view diagram let me show you this is back of the board. We can monitor the board under a thermal camera and see what gets hot. We want to narrow down where that short is coming from. We can inject voltage on any one of the red dots that you see on the board. voltage right on this side of the board right at the cap over the chip and something got hot right next to the touch I see. Based on my experience working on iPhone 6s it's almost always never this IC that is causing the short. inductor does not show to ground and doctors and resistors do not short to ground if I am to take an educated guess I would go for this component or this component those are big caps and those caps can cause a short circuit. We're going to inject voltage at any one of the two caps from the bottom and then we can apply alcohol isopropyl. think we got it this guy right here just flick off that cap meter in diet mode and let's measure right here wow no short wow we did it we do not have a shot anymore. We're gonna start the backup process and then we can call the customer to come and pick up. all bosses don't forget to like and subscribe and we'll do something else in the next video.",

      "title": "iPhone 6 Battery Replacement in 4 Minutes",
      "transcript": "All right, today I'm going to show you how\nto replace the battery in your iPhone 6. If you want to watch any of these other repair\nvideos, go ahead and click the links in that menu. Here's the iPhone 6. We're going to\ngo ahead and turn it off and then we're going to take out the bottom screws. They're a Pentalobe\nscrew, and if you don't have a Pentalobe screwdriver go ahead and check the video description,\nI'll link some tools and replacement parts there for you. Take a suction cup and lift\nup on the screen just a little bit, and then you can take a pry tool, metal or plastic,\nand lift up on the metal frame of the screen itself, so you don't bend it too much. Because\nif you bend the screen, it's going to crack, and then you have a much more expensive repair.\nLift the screen up, and then you are going to want to remove the screen for this. So\nthere's five screws on this metal plate. Remove the metal plate. Because you get a little\naggressive when you're trying to pull the battery out of the phone. Because of the way\nit's glued down. Anyway, there's four little ribbing cables, just kind of like little LEGOs,\nthat you unsnap from the main board. So lift those off and then the screen comes loose\nfrom the phone. Once again, replacement parts are in the video description. You can check\nthose out. Now the battery is held down by one little ribbing cable. It's underneath\nthis metal plate, so take off those two screws and remove the metal plate. And then unclip\nthe little battery connector right here. Now this is the part where it gets a little bit\nharder. The battery is glued inside of the phone so you want to warm up the phone a little\nbit from the back. Do it long enough that the heat seeps through and gets through the\nglue, so do it for probably, you know, a minute or two. But don't let the phone get too hot\nso you can't touch it anymore because at that point you'll start damaging components. So\njust warm up the phone long enough to melt the glue in the back. Anyway, I'm not going\nto edit any part of this out, I'm just going to speed it up a little bit so you can see\nhow hard it is to get the battery out. You want to pry up but just make sure you don't\npry it against anything important or slip too far underneath the battery or you might\nslice some of the ribbing cables that go to the volume buttons or the power buttons. So\njust kind of wedge it under there and then pry up a little bit. But be super careful.\nStill just lifting the battery up, there's an incredible amount of glue under here. It\ngets kind of ridiculous at this point. Try to leave as much glue inside of the phone\nas possible. That way, you don't have to reuse any sticky tape, you can just reuse the same\nglue again. Anyway, now that the glue is unstuck from the battery you can check out this identity\ncrisis. It says 6.91 and 7.01 on the batteries. I guess Apple couldn't make up their mind\non how big the battery itself was. Anyway if your glue is still in there you can reuse\nit, otherwise grab some double sided sticky tape and just stick it back down. Make it\nenough that the battery doesn't shift around while you're using your phone or while it's\nin your pocket. Go ahead and rip off the back of the sticky tape. And then plug the battery\nback in, and then set the battery back into its little slot. I plug it in first just so\nit's lined up with the connection points. Now I'm going to put the metal bracket back\non along with the two little screws. And then I can plug in the screen again. Each of these\nlittle connectors are going to snap in just like a little LEGO piece. Just work your way\ndown and then get this last one right here for the front camera. And then screw in that\nmetal plate with the five screws again. Anyway, pretty straightforward, fold the screen down.\nYou're going to want to line up the top of the screen with the phone first, making sure\nit's flush, and then you can kind of just pinch your way down the sides of the phone\nsnapping it back into place. But if the top isn't lined up, the connections aren't going\nto be lined up either. Get the two screens in the bottom there, and there you go. If\nyou have any questions, make sure to leave them in the comments, don't forget to like\nif this video helped you, and don't forget to subscribe. It does mean a lot. Hope to\nsee you around. Thanks for watching.",

      "title": "How To: Samsung Galaxy Alpha Screen Replacement",
      "transcript": "do hello and welcome to another retro crazy not so retro this time however this is my samsung galaxy alpha the g850 model i believe it is and when it was released it was samsung's flagship smartphone the first to come with a cnc'd frame now when i upgraded quite a while ago the phone became redundant and my father at the time was looking for a phone so i passed the phone on to him unfortunately my father being my father and his record with glasses and phones being what it is it didn't even last two months before as you can maybe tell from what you can see it got dropped now even though it was in a protective case and it had a screen protector on it he managed to drop it and smash the screen you can see all the spiders webs through now to the best of my knowledge if i switch this on it should be powering up there is zero display however what i do find is that on checking i am getting sound uh and it is still charging so i'm hoping it's nothing more than the screen that's gone now modern bonded screens what do you do most people oh uh hand it into somewhere to get fixed that costs an arm and a leg or you know throw it away and get an upgrade or claim on your insurance or whatever however a quick trip to ebay got me a replacement screen now i went for the cheapest screen i could because obviously it's an old phone now this cost about 30 pounds it's not the right color but it is the same screen so i'm going to look and see if i can fit this onto the damaged one and get it running so the first things you need to do is make sure you take the backing off which i've already done the battery is actually plugged in now i think this is powered up you can't really tell but i'm just going to pop the battery out i was using a spare battery as a stand to stop the lovely screen glare from the lights so i'll quickly tell you the process i'm going to use to replace this hopefully the only tools i'm really going to need are a blade of some shape former description a pry tool so that i can actually get this off and i need to remove these two screws that hopefully is all the tools i need so i'll start off by removing these two screws i'm then going to use hot air just round the edge where the glue is and that's to try and soften the glue so that i can actually start prying up the damaged screen so i can look at replacing it and getting it out now it's important to note where everything is now first your cheats away with any screen that you're replacing is have a look at the existing one now this one has the main connector here which means when you flip it over we've got the main connector sat here we've got the two buttons which are here and then the cut out goes round the main home button so i need to make sure that when i open this that i effectively break the seal around and then make sure i've disconnected the lcd lift it to then make sure i can carefully remove anything that's attached here on this lcd before i can then plug this in do a check make sure everything's fine and stick it down sounds simple and straightforward never done it before don't even know if the phone is actually fully functional underneath here whether it's just the screen but let's find out at this point i should point out that i will be using my rework station and i'm going to be using the hot air gun itself to heat the screen now i've set this to 100 degrees i'm not looking to melt this but you should be able to use a hot air gun or potentially a hair dryer set to its hottest setting what you're trying to do is just soften up the glue enough that it'll become malleable and you'll be able to pry everything up so let me set this to the side and let's get cracking okay i'm in and off now that i can see the edge connector for the screen so i'm just going to pop that that's now what's left of the damaged screen away so that can go to the bin we'll clean this up in preparation for the new screen now that's all cleaned up next it's to connect the screen and see if the phone actually works we do this before we use the adhesive otherwise we've wasted a screen okay the battery is flat but i've got a display excellent excellent right now i need to pop the battery back out remove the protective plastic stick everything down put on the remaining two screws charge the battery and see if we have a fully functional phone so this has now been charging for a short while it was sitting about seven percent eight percent i'm going to try and power it on at that and we'll see what happens see if it works well touch screen's working you can see a reaction swiping works and home button works does the volume should never be affected excellent everything's working so there we go you don't have to spend an absolute fortune to get a very good old phone back up and running there you go so thank you for watching i hope you found this useful it does mean that other phones have a similar style you can also attempt to replace the screen because they should all be fairly similar oh there you go i'll just hide that and see you on the next retro crazy you",

      "title": "Amazon Fire Phone Teardown Review",
      "transcript": "last month Amazon announced the fir phone equipped with this cool Dynamic perspective feature the phone will also have a lot of Amazon specific features like the Firefly recognition software the MayDay support service and free Prime for a year all of which is sure to please the Amazon loving crowd but will it be enough to grab a wider Market who knows but what I know is we got our hands on one and we're going to tear it down hi I'm gwendaline with iix it and today Amazon set the are pretty high with the features jam-packed into their fir phone but will the repairability score be enough to impress us design-wise the fire phone is simple just a rounded black box with a glass screen the front of the phone has the most notable features including a raised home button and five visible cameras most of which handle the head tracking involved with the phone's Dynamic display sizewise the Fire Phone measures in at 139.26 6.5 mm it is 8.9 mm thick and weighs in at 1 160 G getting into the phone proved easy enough our cursory inspection greeted us with two non-proprietary T3 screws this tear down is off to a pleasant start and with the help of our handy ice clack we get our first look inside the fire foam in order to separate the back pane we just needed to disconnect a few ribbon cables on the front half we see the battery motherboard and pretty much everything that makes up the phone and on the other we have a tab that alerts Amazon to the fact that the phone has been opened sorry Amazon as we work on getting the battery out we run into a few brackets under option number one there's no battery connector so we move on to option two where we find what we're looking for but we also see that the battery is held in place by some familiar adhesive we've seen adhesive tabs like this before in both the iPhone 5s and 5C and after some sticky resistance the battery is out this is a 2400 milliamp hour battery that Amazon claims will give you 85 hours of standby time up to 22 hours of talk time up to 65 5 hours of audio playback and up to 11 hours of video playback with the battery out we set our sights on the motherboard but it looks like the rear-facing camera is not ready to let go after some spudger and unscrewing we get the motherboard free don't worry rear facing camera we'll come back to you soon the motherboard is home to the 2 GB of Samsung made lpddr3 RAM and likely underneath that is the 2.2 GHz quadcore Snapdragon 800 processor right next door you'll find the 32 GB of Samsung made e MMC nand flash memory along the bottom of the phone you'll find the densely populated peripheral cable that is home to a number of components including the micro USB port the speaker phone speaker the microphone and two of the four front-facing infrared LEDs much like the Xbox Connect the Amazon fir phone uses the LEDs to blast out infrared light that the four Dynamic perspective cameras interpret to create the dynamic perspective effects speaking of those Dynamic perspective cameras we found them thoroughly glued in place right below that cable these cameras require careful calibration and it looks like Amazon isn't taking any chances with them slipping out of place which means for us to remove them we're going to have to do some serious frying other than the four Dynamic perspective cameras in the phone the Amazon Fire also has a 13 megapix rear facing camera that we removed earlier and a 2.1 megapixel front-facing camera last but certainly not least we have the front panel assembly it took some heat from our eye opener to soften the adhesive holding it together but we got the mid-frame separated from the display this display is a 4.7 in IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 at 315 pixels per inch we've come to the end of our tear down which means it's time to talk repairability and I fix it it's our mission to teach people how to repair everything so we give every Gadget we tear down a repairability score between 1 and 10 10 being the easiest to repair and one being the most difficult the Amazon Fire Phone got a three out of 10 and here's why on the upside external non proprietary screws mean no adhesive holding the device together and an easier time getting in but on the downside tons of cables and connectors make disassembly tedious and reassembly difficult the four Dynamic perspective cameras are encased in glue replacement will mean Heating and cutting a replacement display assembly will need to include four replacement cameras or will require a lot of extra work transferring cameras and finally the fir phone is not modular several component share cables which means an increase in cost of replacement parts and that's our tear down for the complete tear down including tons of beautiful highquality images head on over to ifixit.com don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel to stay up to date on all our latest tear downs and repair videos

      "transcript": "Hey ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Indra gadgets one plus one complete teardown and reinstallation all right so go ahead and start this repair we're going to use our is mo tool we carry these on our website if you haven't already go ahead remove your SIM card and SIM card tray this one already had it removed so we're going to just go ahead and use our Isis MO tool and kind of separate the front LCD assembly housing frame from the back door battery cover I promise this is not as hard as it looks the problem is I had just clipped my fingernails and it was really hurting to get my fingers in between the frame so this really isn't as hard as it looks alright with that removed we're going to use our small tip tweezers we carry this in one of our iFixit 54 bit kits we partnered up with them to carry some of their tool kits and we're going to remove this little plastic gasket that covers over one of the double zero Phillips screws please note there are actually four more little plastic gaskets covering double zero Phillips screws the screwdriver we're going to use is actually the one in our 54 bit I fix it tool kit and we also carry a slightly cheaper one on our website this one right here is between six to seven dollars it's got a Phillips screwdriver our nylon spudger pentalobe screwdriver that's great for iPhone repairs to baby now we're going to start removing some screws please note there's an additional five screws that we're going to remove after these screws so don't get carry that carried away and start trying to pry off the back little clips from the frame of the phone without seeing us completely remove all these screws first all right with those screws removed we're going to go head and remove formular little gaskets covering up for additional double zero Phillips screws so we're going to remove those right now and after that there's an additional screw on the top right-hand side cover up cover it up by a little white film so you'll want to remove that screw as well all right with those screws I'll remove let's go ahead and grab our ISS MO tool and separate the clips on the top and the bottom if the top one doesn't come loose please note there is little battery flex cable still kind of attached so you will need to disconnect that and of course the bottom one should just come loose very easily all right there's me removing that little battery flex cable and also seem to pop off from the board when I disconnected it so now my battery is disconnected from the board as well go ahead and use a nylon spudger I don't like to remove the battery with any metal but we are now going to go ahead and remove the battery I like to start from either the side or the bottom of the battery it should lift off please note the right side of the battery is a ton of adhesive it'll come off fairly easily but once again use plastic or the nylon spudger to kind of loosen it up don't break your battery your battery is a little malleable but you don't want to bend it obviously to a crazy extent okay go ahead and grab your nylon spudger again and we're going to disconnect some flex cables from the board pretty much that right there is the digitizer flex cable and we will be replacing that a little bit later with an actual brand new assembly we're going to disconnect these other three flex cables right here and I disappointed the rear camera flex cable not necessary I found that out later but you don't need to disconnect like I did additionally you will need to use the little tweezers to lift off the volume as well as the power little ribbon cable so you'll see me do that be very careful in doing it you obviously don't want to break these flex cables and lastly there is another double zero Phillips screw right there I try to get it in as close as I couldn't show you guys what it looks like and you will need to remove this to get the logic board away from the actual the actual back housing of the phone I never liked the work on a logic board when I'm trying to heat up the phone and we do have to heat up the phone to remove the LCD digitizer assembly all right so right now I'm using the needle nose pliers that we used in our iFixit tool kit I really do love these pliers if you want you can heat up this little flex cable a little bit trying to loosen up adhesive but I just went under it with pliers not pliers please make the tweezers and of course the power button flex as well all right with that removed like I said right here I disconnected the rear camera later found out not really necessary but it does help the the motherboard come out of the phone a little bit easier and of course at the very top this is the LCD flex cable needs to disconnect that because we're actually going to be replacing it and with that disconnected we can go ahead and remove our motherboard from the actual back housing frame of the phone and so that's what I'm doing right here last note is that there is one little antenna coaxial flex cable connected under the board board I just did disconnected right there you will need to reconnect it later otherwise you may not get signal you may not get Wi-Fi I'm not quite sure what coaxial cable that is but I'm pretty sure it's important so make sure to reconnect that later and I'll of course zoom in for you guys trying to show you guys what I'm reconnecting alright so now I'm going to go ahead and use our heat gun if you don't have a heat gun you can use a blow dryer if you don't have a blow dryer you can buy our iOpener we carry that eye opener on our website just showing you guys what we're going to replace right here that's a brand new assembly we're going to replace the digitizer flex cable right there the long one and the very top is the LCD flex cable those are the two we're going to replace so that gives you an idea of what you're doing before you actually do it and this is our iOpener from iFixit once again we partnered up with them you would take this you would put it into a microwave it gets hot it heats up the frame of the glass and voila it has come loose I'm using the heat gun I just don't want to go to a microwave so I use our heat gun if you do have a heat gun that allows you to set the temperature I recommend anywhere from 180 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit for those of you in Europe and everywhere that's not America I'm sorry I don't know the Celsius conversion I'm sure you can google it shouldn't take that much time with enough heat apply you can go and user is SM O'Toole try and break between the crease in your one plus one please note that the very top and sides of the screen is actually a frame you don't want to remove the frame so be careful we're really just removing the actual glass assembly and I'm going to try and show you guys what the frame looks like right here so that you don't break it it's a little black border right here I'm pointing it out don't break that it's not part of your replacement screen so we actually had a customer calls him and say hey my oneplus one screen is it's smaller than the one that was on my phone the one you guys sent me and of course I asked the customer if he had broken off the black little bezel and yes he did so don't do that alright so there are LCD assembly comes loose go ahead and remove any remnant glass please make sure you go all the way along the sides the top the bottom because obviously if you put your new glass in and you have any remnant glass you could end up cracking your brand new glass and that would just suck all right and then one thing I wanted to note out to you guys is on your original screen there is little ear speaker mesh you will want to pop that out and transfer it over to your brand new screen if you don't transfer it over you're not going to have speaker mention there so make sure you transfer it over a little it is a little metal piece so comes off pretty easily and it goes right into the new one pretty easily alright alright so I'm using our red tape I kind of glimpsed it right there I lined it up around the side to top the bottom it's pretty much a double-sided adhesive that kind of holds a new screen in place we are going to work to get some tape templates off but as at the time of this video we don't have any out yet alright the top plugs cable is pretty explanatory and the bottom flex cable make sure you thread it in through the second hole as I show you right here you don't want to write it through that bottom first hole because it's not really supposed to go through there so make sure you thread it through the top hole and make sure it comes all the way up to the top you'll notice when you're reinstalling it's a little bit loose not a big deal but it does need to go to that second hole to be honest with you it might be able to go through the first hole but I noticed that when we took it apart the original screen was through the second hole so I did it that way you'll want to go ahead and press your screen down maybe put some books on it later trying to secure the adhesive to the new frame alright let's go ahead and grab our logic board first things first go ahead and make sure that this little antenna coaxial cable is plugged back into your actual motherboard like I said if you don't plug this in then you might not have reception you might not have Wi-Fi I don't know what it does but I know it's an antenna cable so you want to make sure you plug that in properly it's a little tricky I do finally get it plugged in right there and now we can go ahead and lay our motherboard back onto the frame housing of the phone all right let's go ahead and plug in all of these flex cables and of course push our volume and power button flex back into their correct places now it's going to grab our battery put that back into its spot and plug that flex cable in as well okay you see me put the top in I forgot to screw in that left side screw so ignore me putting the top in because I'm going to take it right back out and I'll show you guys to put the screw in so I'm going to kind of speed this up just to show you guys that I put the top and the bottom in and I took the top right off and put the screw in okay so this is the top removed again I'll go ahead and grab that screw and the double zero Phillips screwdriver screw that in and of course put the top back on alright so this is a lot of screws obviously so I'm going to speed this up a little bit one thing you will want to note is the four screws that are covered up by those little plastic gaskets or the rubber gaskets are of different sizes so you don't want to mix those up obviously because those need to go into their respective places and then of course once I've got those in I go ahead and put the cast little gaskets back on one set is dead done go ahead and grab your backdoor battery cover go ahead and clip that back into place put your SIM card and SIM card tray back into the phone go ahead and power it up boot it up and your phone should be good to go like I said you can use a little set of books or something to put some weight down and throw any of your parts tools accessories whatever it may be please visit us at Android gadgets com that's the oneplus one",

      "title": "OnePlus One Screen Replacement Repair How To Change",
      "transcript": "hey guys so today I wanted to make a video to show you how to change the LCD screen assembly on the oneplus one include links in the video description for any tools that I'm going to be using during this process today and any parts that I'm going to be replacing I'll include links where I found them for the best price so you can check them out there so the first thing you want to do is make sure your device is powered off and then you can use the sim eject tool and make sure to remove the SIM card tray here to start removing the back cover what I found works really well if you have like a screwdriver or something you can just carefully pry in here by the headphone jack just to get it started a little bit the back will start separating a little bit right there then we can do is use something like a plastic pry tool like this or something and if you get started here just keep working your way around sometimes the corners are the trickiest right there so just keep working your way around then once you get close and you get these usually the whole part comes off just like that next what we need to do is use the tweezers or something and remove these little covers covering the screws there's two down here and there's three up here so we'll go ahead and remove those using a tweezers or something to get them off next what we will need to do is use a Phillips screwdriver size zero zero zero and we're going to need to remove all these screws on the bottom and the top here now all the ones that you removed the plugs out here the covers for the screws those are different size so make sure to keep them separate I would recommend layin these all out in the order that you take them out that way you know exactly where they go back there's one screw up in this top corner that's covered with a white protective cover as well and you want to pull that off and remove that screw as well so there's 15 total so next what we can do is use something like a screw driver or something that you can pry with carefully right here in the headphone jack just pry up carefully and if you can get it under there way you can get your fingernail under and hold it then if you can pry up with something carefully and then this pier will pop up like that and then excuse my hands but you can just tip this up and it just comes apart like that so next what you want to do is using your plastic pry tool or your fingernail or something go ahead and remove all these connectors here we're going to start with this one right here do the battery next now I'd recommend a plastic pry tool versus a metal one just so sure don't damage anything get all these connectors down through here there's this connector over here next what you want to do for this volume button right here we're going to have to remove this flex cable right here what I've found that seems to work the best is if you start right in here with something very carefully start on this part right here and you can just kind of work it over as you go just held in with some adhesive and then it just comes loose like that so now the power button on this side is the same way just work that loose now next there's a Philips screw right in here that we're going to have to remove I already removed it but I just want to show you next we will need something to pry with very carefully pry up on the board and just watch the power and volume button here now you want to just carefully pry up like this then there's an antenna wire right in here that we're going to need to disconnect next I can't really show it the best disconnecting it but it's right in there then once you do that then the board is free to come right out if you have a plastic pry tool so you don't damage anything I found that it's almost easiest to slide in right on top of this connector right here just be careful and if you slide in there if you use a plastic one like this it won't damage the connector under there if you keep it pretty flat then you can just pry there's some adhesive under this corner and back here and the main part is on here so what we're going to attempt to do is to pry up under here and it acts like it's coming pretty loose pretty easy but it seems pretty hard at the same time now you can get it tipped up somewhat like this but then the hardest part is back in this corner here and what you're going to need to do is slide under here if I can show it here kind of hard to show it with the light but it's right down in here so what you can do is just use this plastic pry tool and just go back and forth down in here and you can cut through this white adhesive here so then it ends up coming out just like that now you can see what I mean about that you just cut it through like this with your plastic pry tool and then you're all set so next what we'll want to do is use a pry tool and go under down here by the charging port and we're going to pry up a little bit then once you a little crack established there we can just pry up this bottom part comes off with the loudspeaker and everything so next we will need to take your tweezers or something and remove this little piece of adhesive right here next we can take this plastic pry tool or something and go under this right here and you can just carefully work your way up through you can pull up a little bit take a little of the tension off if you want try to remove my hands out of the way here so this part comes off so next we want to take something and remove this little microphone right here this just stuck down with adhesive just loosen that so then we can pull up on this very carefully and we can just pry up on this now be careful for this little piece going under here under the mid frame here we're going to just try to work it loose a little bit we're going to work this loose all the way down then we just want to pull that out sideways like that then we can start under here and work this loose it's just stuck done with adhesive just keep working it all the way over now we come to this point here as well where we have to remove this adhesive strip here just pull this right off the antennas under here we need to pull this antenna wire off then what we can do is just use like tweezers or something and pry up on this antenna wire right here remove this antenna wire now we'll remove the wire as well we're going to be swapping this over to the new screen then this whole part comes loose just like this now the next thing we want to do is use the tweezers or something and go under this earpiece speaker right up here you can go underneath it it has adhesive under it you just kind of rock it and pick it up and then they hey Steve in this case came right out with it and sometimes you may have to pull the adhesive loose and swap it over to the new screen if you want to swap it over to a new screen or you can just dig out the old adhesive and put it in there so now this video is for replacing the screen that has a frame included I'm not going to separate the frame you would have to go ahead and heat this up all the way around and you would have to really carefully separate this frame from the LCD part but it's not very much more money to get LCD with the frame included on links in the video description where you can find some it's only like 20 bucks more so I would recommend to get the frame and everything included because there's so much less work for you and you don't have to get adhesive that way everything is preassembled now all you need to do is swap all your parts over that we just took off to the new screen so we're going to use this for the new screen and we're going to start putting everything back together so first what you want to do first what you want to do is start with your earpiece speaker you want to grab that and it has a notch on this side and a notch on this side you can see it only can go one way so you want to set that right down in there into your new frame push down next what we're going to do is get this antenna wire in here just close because we're not going to connect it yet and we're going to grab this part here and we're going to set it down in here get this antenna wire out of the way for now now we're just going to set it right down in where it goes and it snaps right in place you want to watch this microphone here make sure to set that where it goes make sure it sticks down properly then we're going to reconnect this antenna wire make sure that it's connected properly since we're on this antenna wire we're just going to go ahead and put it in all the way in the channel where it's supposed to go once you get it in where it's supposed to go then we'll grab our adhesive tape stick it back on here keeps the wire in the right spot next what we're going to do is stick this down now let's start with this little tab right here that over in under in the mid frame there into place and you can pretty much kind of see where this goes like it just follows this line here next we'll want to set the charging port down in here it just kind of sits right in place where it goes you just want to stick that down next we want to take this adhesive strip put it down in here just do the best you can it won't stay perfect then if you're new frame doesn't have any adhesive in it for the battery what you can do is just get something like this I'll link to this in the description as well you can get this adhesive tape it's like a two-sided tape and this is pretty narrow it's like two millimeter I think but you can get it wider and I would recommend just putting a few strips on here where you can see in your old frame it has it and then a few places here don't put any on top of these flex cables but you can put some on this side and some on this side and if you end up having to do that you can just go ahead and peel your adhesive and you can grab your battery and just set it right down in there make sure it's tucked down good and we'll grab the loudspeaker right here set it down and push it down next to reinstall the logic board we need to do is reconnect this antenna wire right here onto the logic board right here getting this antenna wire hooked up is a little tricky because you don't have a whole lot of length to work with but what I found is if you just get down in there and use your fingernails and thumb nail to push it together it seemed to work the best just make sure it's seated properly just be patient with it take your time then once you're all done with that now we got to set the board down in here we got to watch a lot of connectors so let's make sure this one stays out of the way and just make sure that these are all up out of the way here and then it should just kind of sit right down in there make sure that the rear camera is sitting down properly make sure the front camera is sitting down properly and then we'll go ahead and put this black screw in over here before we forget it right there and then we're going to work on reconnecting everything so let's go ahead and reconnect this connector up here make sure the camera is sitting down properly like I said the rear and the front camera so let's just go down the row here so now let's just make sure these are all connected down through here all five of these this one and then what we want to do is reconnect these volume buttons right here they just have adhesive on them they just kind of set right down and you can pretty much tell they just go right in place so the power button then the volume buttons right here they go right in place next we'll grab this cover set it right down on here should just snap right in and we'll go ahead and put all our screws back in here and and now put these plugs in these covers after you put these screws in next go ahead and put the screws on the bottom here and these two plugs in after you put these screws in to put the back cover back on just grab your back cover set it down on here start at the top and work your way down around just make it snap in all the way you can check your reveals all the way around and grab your SIM card put your SIM card back in and you're all set thanks for watching",

      "summary": "Hey guys so today I wanted to make a video to show you how to change the LCD screen assembly on the oneplus one. The first thing you want to do is make sure your device is powered off and then you can use the sim eject tool. Make sure to remove the SIM card tray here to start removing the back cover. and you get these usually the whole part comes off just like that next what we need to do is use the tweezers or something and remove these little covers covering the screws there's two down here and there's three up here. headphone jack just pry up carefully and if you can get it under there way you canget your fingernail under and hold it. Next what you want to do is using your plastic pry tool or your fingerail or something go ahead and remove all these connectors. loose like that so now the power button on this side is the same way just work that loose now next there's a Philips screw right in here that we're going to have to remove I already removed it but I just want to show you next. we're going to attempt to do is to pry up under here and it acts like it's coming pretty loose pretty easy but it seems pretty hard at the same time now you can get it tipped up somewhat like this but then the hardest part is back in this corner here. and remove this little piece of adhesive right here next we can take this plastic pry tool or something and go under this right here and you can just carefully work your way up through. here we need to pull this antenna wire off then what we can do is just use like tweezers or something and pry up on the antenna wire right here. Now this video is for replacing the screen that has a frame included. not very much more money to get LCD with the frame included on links in the video description where you can find some it's only like 20 bucks more so I would recommend to get the frame and everything included because there's so much less work for you and you don't have to get adhesive that way everything is preassembled. way for now now we're just going to set it right down in where it goes and it snaps right in place you want to watch this microphone here. We're going to reconnect this antenna wire make sure that it's connected properly. won't stay perfect then if you're new frame doesn't have any adhesive in it for the battery what you can do is just get something like this. If you end up having to do that you can just go ahead and peel your adhesive and you can grab your battery and just set it right down in there. length to work with but what I found is if you just get down in there and use your fingernails and thumb nail to push it together it seemed to work the best just make sure it's seated properly just be patient with it. five of these this one and then what we want to do is reconnect these volume buttons right here they just have adhesive on them they just kind of set right down and you can pretty much tell they just go right in place.",

      "title": "OnePlus One SIM card not detected repair [ModzLink.com]",
      "transcript": "hey guys um last week I had a problem with my phone I was actually trying to take it apart this is my my phone here this is a OnePlus One it's actually a very nice phone um the only thing though is their customer support is absolutely horrible um I was trying to get this out this SIM card off uh and then take the cover off because you can take this cover off uh let me show you so as you can tell this cover is kind of difficult to take off as I was trying to take it apart this little Sim ejector tool fell in here I was trying to use it to lift this off but it fell in there and got stuck um I I was able to take it out by using a piece of cardboard to uh slip it under there and then get this out however my SIM card slot no longer works and it's not detecting my sim so I emailed OnePlus One um emailed them back and forth for about a week uh and I didn't get anywhere they wanted me to send them pictures of what the phone looks like and uh and uh as well as the ime or IMI number uh two or three times I had to repeat myself multiple times there customer service is just bad um it doesn't change the phone the phone is still an awesome phone you just need to be very careful with this phone if you ever get one anyways I was trying to take this off to see if I could fit a wireless charger here um my Nexus 7 just died and I noticed that it had a wireless charger inside so I wanted to mod it and put it in here um as I was doing that the Little Sim injector tool fell in there got stuck I was able to remove it I didn't feel like anything broke inside um but OnePlus One still refused to just swap swap my phone out for a different one there's nothing wrong with it other than the SIM card uh slot here so I went ahead and went on eBay and just in case I got me another one that has a broken screen so I can use this one um for parts or if I can fix this if I can fix mine then um then I can use this one and just fix the screen and sell it or have it as a backup anyways this video is to show you guys how to take this apart and I read that lots of people had that same issue where they dropped that in there and it got stuck and they couldn't get it out um so I'm going to try and take this apart and see if I can fix the pins in there or if I need to replace the whole SIM card uh uh module here but yeah let's go ahead and get started here if you have one of these phones right here where the Sim slot is you actually need to put your fingernail in here and then just run it down and run it up and you'll feel all the clips become unsnapped and then the cover should come off I'll be using my screwdriver set here um this is for small electronics so if you need one of these I'll have a link in the description to where you can purchase one all right so it looks like we just have a bunch of very small Phillip screws around the edge there so we'll get all of those out for this I'm using a 0000 bit so this is the screw that marks if you voided your warranty if the camera will focus right there this one has a little white sticker on top so now my warranty's void uh so there's no way I can send this phone back at this point there's 10 total screws for the case there all right next we got to take out this red battery so if you start digging at it from this side this is where most of the glue is so we should be able to get this lifted with batteries you have to be very careful because you can break them very easily if you bend them too much so the battery is loose there and it looks like there's a ribbon cable that goes in so I'm not going to mess with that just yet all right after doing that there are some hidden uh screws right there right there right there there's a couple down here it looks like so take these rubber pads out if you have tweezers like this really fine tweezers you can just poke at them these rubber pads like this and then lift them out so we have three more screws at the top there and two at the bottom when you take phones apart you need to be sure that you're very organized as to where your screws are because some of these are different sizes um so you just need to make sure you put them back in the correct spot these screws at the bottom are kind of difficult to get out there we go so those two at the bottom are actually a bit smaller than the rest just make sure you keep track of those and where they go all right now that you're done with that get your battery and move it out like this the ribbon cable actually lets you slide the battery out like this slightly be careful with it still and then you can get your little plastic tool and get it right here and you can start lifting this up so there's the back cover now at this point just to get it out of the way we'll want to uncp the battery just so we don't break it all right next we need to do undo all these uh ribbon cables and we can actually take this bottom plate out if you just put this in here right over the USB uh slot you should be able to open this up now that will come out with the two speakers so we can set that aside and then on the sides here where the the buttons are you actually need to dig this in here into the side to get these out um you can use a knife but I advise against it because you can cut this ribbon cable very easily so there's that one and then there's the power button over here that we need to get out as well all right all right so now that we have the power button out and the volume buttons out um it's actually a lot easier to get these out if you go up here to where the ribbon cable connects to the board and you just stick this in here and just lift it like that so just so you don't break this it's easier to do it that way um next we have one screw right there and we've got a couple of other ribbon ribbons that we need to unplug so there's one and it looks like there's one right here too so this is actually the camera I can't remember how many megapixels it is but it's a very nice camera so we'll go ahead and take that screw out and then we should be able to lift the motherboard out okay so I took that one screw out and now we should be able to lift this I'm going to start from the corner here lifting it very slowly and that's lifting sorry the camera is at a weird angle here so it's kind of hard to maneuver it always be very careful with phones especially um if you can't tell if it's going to rip it or not always double check things oh it looks like right under here actually there's a connector so you can tell right under here that we need to unplug oh it looks like you don't have to be that careful with it if you start pulling on it it will actually show The Wire there so there's the motherboard with that wire and then you can go ahead and unplug that there's the back of my phone and as you can tell there there's a couple of broken pins for my SIM card uh slot so I'll try and resolder those back on and hopefully that fixes the phone all right so the humming noise that you're hearing is actually my uh soldering station so what I'm going to do to fix this is actually remove the buttons uh just to make sure they're not uh going to get in the way so let me go ahead and desolder them and then let me clean up those points really fast and then I'll remove the power button over here on the other side so there's the button if you do this you need to make sure you're very careful um there's a little uh glue pad right there so that one's a little bit more difficult to lift now you want to take off sensitive stuff uh the only thing I can see here is the camera right there so I'll get that taken off that's the front-facing camera now if you ever do this type of work this foil tape is essential so you don't break things on here so I'm going to put some of this on the board and uh um that way I don't fry any of the other components so there we go the only thing I want to heat up is this here so I'll heat this up and see if I can remove it now to do that I'm going to use this hot air all right so here's what I came up with here's my uh reball jig and I just I'm putting some very light pressure here just to hold it steady and uh hopefully this will work I'll go ahead and heat it up and try and lift this out all right so I actually went ahead and added some of this paste and uh I'll try it one more time hopefully it lifts this time all right so that's not going to work I'll try a different way all right so desoldering that didn't work at all um so what I'm doing is using scissors to cut through um The Sim slot so as you can tell there I've already been able to cut through the back holes um I'll cut through all of them here and hopefully I'll be able to just resolder those contacts back all right so after opening up the phone um and prying this with all sorts of tools scissors pliers and even the these I finally got to taking the shield off and there as you can tell the pins are bent some of them are completely gone so now I'll see if I can replace those and then use my SIM card again so I actually found this other phone uh one of my friends actually gave it to me to try and fix this one plus one and right here the battery connectors I pulled this one out just to see how far it would get but it looks like I should be able to use these as metal contacts for my SIM card uh slot here so I'm going to cut these out bend them just the way I need them and then resolder them now I need to test the continuity on this because I'm thinking that these points up here go to this little gold thing that goes around the where the pin is so I'm just going to test that out and see if uh it actually goes to that point so it looks like that is the case so I should be able to solder these without a problem all right so after quite a while of soldering and desoldering and bending pins and everything all the pins are back in there um it looks worse than it is but I'm pretty sure this will fix it so I'm going to put the phone back together and uh see how this works you can't really even tell that it was taken apart other than uh the warranty screw there I'll go ahead and put this back on and turn it on and we'll see if my SIM card works so here's my phone um up there you can see it doesn't have a SIM card I'll go ahead and put it in now well that didn't work so here it is I just ripped off the mle shield and what I'm going to do now is just solder my SIM card onto this um T-Mobile is just going to have to give me a new SIM card whenever I get a new phone or break my phone so there's the whole SIM card slot desoldered going to go ahead and clean this up a little bit with rubbing alcohol so this is what I'm doing now just soldering wires to the direct points it's not going to look that great but it'll work there we go those points look a lot better now a lot more solid um yeah now we'll go ahead and put the SIM card and solder it onto this all right so here's the final product went ahead and soldered my SIM card to the direct points and this should fix it now all right so I just put some tape there just to Shield it um I'll go ahead and put it together now and hopefully that worked so it's back on and it looks like the SIM card still doesn't work so at this point I'm at a loss and my SIM card's most likely broken so I'll need to get a new one all right so this is what ended up happening when I tried to solder my SIM card my soldering iron was at 300° C and the SIM card is made of plastic so it ended up bubbling up just a little bit um on one point the other points were at 200 de so it wasn't that bad either way I had to go back to T-Mobile and get a new SIM card so be careful if you're ever going to solder a SIM card um onto a phone um the next thing is this was not salvageable so if I'm ever able to get a SIM card um board for OnePlus One then I should be able to fix this motherboard and reuse it so I'll keep it maybe eventually I'll find a phone on there for cheap um I ended up having to swap the motherboard out for um this one the one with the shattered screen I swapped the motherboard into this one and uh before I swapped the motherboard I made a full backup using a tww wrp on this one and then just transferred it over to my computer before I took it apart um and then transferred it back to this one so this phone is the exact same as my old one now and you can tell there it's actually detecting the SIM card so yeah anyways this video wasn't really to prove anything other than sometimes when you're modding stuff or fixing stuff you have to improvise and uh figure out how to do things a different way um and also to show you how bad uh OnePlus one's customer service is or customer support is um the phones are awesome but if you do end up getting one of these phones make sure to get a screen protector like I don't know if you can tell on mine but there is a screen protector on there that's been chipped multiple times around the Edge from dropping it um get a hard uh glass cover if you need one I'll have one in the description um but yeah just be careful with these phones if you do end up getting one because their customer support is complete garbage um if anyone knows where I can get a sim adapter for this then please message me um and I'll definitely purchase one if I'm able to anyways that's about it for this video If you guys found this helpful or informative please remember to like comment favorite or share the video and for other tutorials related to gaming or uh PCS please subscribe to my channel anyways as always

      "transcript": "e.com bringing you another video today working on a Samsung Galaxy S5 in today's video we're going to show you the steps necessary to remove and replace the display assembly on your S5 before we get started with our disassemble let's review our suggested tools a spudger fine tipped curved tweezers plastic opening tools Precision Knife Set take Tak a look here at a brand new S5 we're going to begin our entry with the plastic opening tool and finding the notch in the back cover releasing the clips all the way around the perimeter until that back cover comes off let's go ahead and pick up the battery and remove it from the phone here at this time you're going to want to remove your sim card as well as your micro SD card as they're readily available right here access to our S5 internals is somewhat different from previous versions the S3 and S4 as the S5 is built up under the display assembly we're going to bring in our heat gun or blow dryer at this time to begin heating up the adhesive to soften it up to see if we can go ahead and lift the display assembly and access the internals you'll notice the seams on the S5 are quite tight around the display assembly we use the Precision knife kit with the flat blade to begin our entry under the display assembly to cause as little damage as possible once you've begun that separation with the Precision knife we've Then followed up with either a triangle opening tool or a plastic opening tool to continue around the perimeter we found it easiest as you work yourself around the phone to leave something in your tracks to allow the display Assembly not to come back in contact with the adhesive you just picked it up from quite a bit of patience is needed to pick up the display assembly without causing damage to it as as well as the use of additional heat to keep the adhesive softened up until you lift the display assembly completely you can see here that we've released the sides around the entire display showing a small Gap here allowing us access to use the flat side of our spudger to address the adhesive that's on the back of the LCD towards the center of the phone be careful when prying up in the center behind the LCD as you don't want to cause it to flex and possibly crack with the LCD released from its adhesive we want to be careful on the home button side as the ribbon cable is still connected to the motherboard you're going to want to use the flat side of your spudger to pry the physical home button off the bottom side of the display assembly before completely removing your display don't forget to unplug it from your motherboard here we use our curved tweezers to pry up on the connection so that we can remove remove the display assembly completely from our phone let's go ahead and get started with the reassemble of our S5 starting with our new adhesive strips that we've laid down here on the earpiece speaker side as well as the home button side of things we send out free adhesive strips with all of our replacement parts you're going to cut the adhesive with either scissors or your Precision knife to size and length and then lay it in place accordingly you'll also notice here on our display assembly that on the side of the LCD we've went ahead and laid the adhesive strips directly onto the display we also laid a small strip of adhesive here in the body of the phone for the ribbon wire for our home button the home button assembly is also very specific when rebuilding before putting it onto the display assembly make sure that when you're putting it together that the home button sits in the plastic grooves correctly and Then followed up by the rubber backing that adheres to the bottom of the plastic if you get lost the rubber backing does have very specific indentation and grooves that will indicate the correct positioning with your assembly rebuilt let's peel up the covers for our adhesive strips here so we can position the ribbon wire accordingly with our home button securely in place we're going to put two small strips of adhesive on either side of the home button to assist in holding down the display assembly when we press it back down to the body let's now lift the covers on the rest of our adhesive strips here when you're preparing the adhesive for your replacement parts be certain to cut holes for your front-facing camera proximity sensor as well as your earpiece speaker here forgetting to do so will cause your phone not to function properly let's now position our display so we can plug it back into the motherboard press firmly down on the wafer connection making sure that it doesn't come loose when we're maneuvering it down to the adhesive let's line up our display with the body of the phone now starting up here with the earpiece speaker and then working ourselves down the sides and centering the home button down here at the bottom press our new display firmly down around the perimeter of the phone we like to use a little bit of heat here to soften up the adhesive to set it in properly once you feel like the display is securely in its new adhesive we're now in our home stretch to rebuild the back of our phone here don't forget to install your sim card and micro SD cards here in the slots we can now reinstall our battery putting on the rear case here and snapping the clips all the way around the perimeter and then we can power the phone on checking for full functionality and there you have it another successful repair by fix easy.com all of the parts and tools you've seen today in

      "transcript": "repairs universe bringing you another repair video today looks like we're gonna be working on the HTC One m8 in today's video we're gonna show you the steps necessary to remove and replace the display assembly on your m8 before we get started with our disassemble let's review our suggested tools small Phillips screwdriver t5 Torx screwdriver a spudger SIM card ejection tool fine-tipped curved tweezers precision knife set a heat gun or a blow dryer taking a look here at our m8 before we start any part of the disassemble let's go ahead and power down the unit we're gonna look to begin our entry by removing the top and bottom grilles on either side of the display assembly we're gonna begin first with our heat gun or blow dryer applying a small amount of heat to soften up the adhesive to make peeling up these grilles a little easier you'll see we used a precision knife kit to begin the separation of our grilles the seams on the m8 are very tight so we prefer to use the thinnest edge possible to begin our separation of these grilles as to not Mar up the sides of our outside framework when peeling these up we did try to cause as little damage as possible but do keep in mind you will receive another set of replacement grilles along with your new display assembly you we've got a series of six screws that's going to be securing the display assembly down it's a combination of two small Phillips screws and t5 Torx bit screws for the other four you if you haven't done so already you can remove the SIM card tray as well as the micro SD card tray from the sides of the phone using a SIM card removal tool or a paper clip very similar to the grills on the front of our phone we have very type seams on our m8 we found it easiest and caused the least amount of damage using a precision knife kit to pop free the clips you you'll see we freed a few on each side of the phone before finally taking a firm grip of the display assembly and peeling away the back housing you be sure to keep track of that power button for our reassembly later once into our internals you're going to recognize the majority of our connections is covered up for protective tape let's remove that tape by using a little bit of heat from our heat gun or blow-dryer to soften it up making it easier to peel back and not cause damage to our ribbon cables you let's now start getting after some of these connections let's first start with the two coaxial cable connections on this side of the motherboard by simply popping them free below them is the terminal for our battery that's secured with two small Phillips screws let's remove those screws and then pop free our connection you we've also got to coax okay connections on the other side of the motherboard that we want to release the rest of our connections are locking sockets that we want to flip up to release before sliding the ribbon cables out let's not forget our coaxial cable connection here in the corner and then now we can go through and back out all of our ribbon cables from our locking sockets keep in mind this connection here has our volume buttons adhered to the side of the phone you'll see that we use the small amount of heat so that we could peel up that volume button before completely backing out the ribbon cable from its socket you let's be careful as we slide the rest of our ribbon cables safely out of their sockets you we've got three t5 Torx bits screws securing this top board down let's go ahead and back those screws out and then it should release this top board for complete removal you we've got this plastic cover that we to remove that's just above the rear-facing camera and now let's release some of our connections starting here first with the front-facing camera a connection here for our display assembly one more here on the other side of the display assembly and then we also have a small plug here for the vibration motor be careful with this one when you're backing it out as it has slightly delicate the vibration motor should pick right up out of its housing we can now slide the ribbon cables out from either side for our display assembly you've got four small securing Phillips screws one on either corner of this portion of our board let's back those out let's not forget to peel up our proximity sensor in the top of the phone you'll see here we use a little bit of heat to soften up the adhesive to make peeling it back a little easier we've got a final screw securing this portion of our board down hiding here under our rear facing camera let's back that screw out and our board should be free for complete removal let's continue on by removing our front-facing camera our earpiece speaker is sitting nicely in its housing we can peel it up now our loudspeakers gonna be next will again use a little bit of heat to soften it up and then we'll use our tweezers to gently peel it up from its location our dock port assembly should peel up just as easily we'll use a plastic spudger here as to try to not cause damage to the bottom side of our assembly with the dock port out of our way the battery in the center of the phones going to be last it is held down with quite a bit of adhesive we recommend that you take your time use plenty of heat and a plastic spudger you with a little bit of patience you'll finally be able to maneuver the battery away from the phone at this point we're going to bring in our replacement part so that we can compare it to our existing display assembly as you'll notice front to back they're identical to each other what we'll be doing is transplanting all the parts that we just removed from our existing display over to our replacement here's those extra grilles that we mentioned earlier in the video for our reassembly let's now begin the reassembly of our m8 you'll notice that we're actually going to be using our existing display because when we first disassembled the phone it wasn't broken let's start first here with our battery and make sure that we align the terminal on the proper side of the phone you'll see we softened up our existing adhesive here with a little bit of heat before setting it in place you our next piece into the bottom of the phone is gonna be our dock board assembly you can press it firmly into the securing adhesive and we even used a little bit of heat to soften it up first next we bring in our loudspeaker over top of the dock port and then we'll flip our phone over to bring our attention to the top portion of it we're gonna bring in our replacement part so we can show you that it has adhesive pre-installed already we're using our existing display so we're gonna heat up the majority of our existing adhesive to get things to settle in nicely the first piece back into the top of our phone is going to be our loudspeaker followed by our front-facing camera into its housing we've got that bottom board that we're going to maneuver back into place but let's check that connections down on the bottom for our rear facing camera to make sure it's secure let's maneuver the board around the connection for our front-facing camera and once in place we can secure the connection for our camera and then bolt down the securing screw that's right below the rear-facing camera we can now reinstall the four securing screws one on each corner of the board you next we secure our proximity sensor into the top of the phone with the remaining adhesive with the sensor secured its location we can now bring our attention to the ribbon wires on each side of the board sliding them into their locking sockets and then flipping the lock down securing the connection we can now push the vibration motor back down into its housing and connect the small plug into the board time to maneuver the top board back down into its location with the mounting screws aligned we can bring in the three Torx screws to secure it down into place you once the board's locked down with its screws let's begin reinstalling all of our ribbon connections sliding the ribbon cables in locking the sockets and securing that connection continue that same pattern with all of our locking sockets all the way around this top board when you get to a coaxial connection like the one here in the corner it's just simply putting it onto the socket and pressing firmly down to secure its connection take your time make sure all of these connections are very secure as you want to make sure the phone fully functions upon power up bringing our attention to the other side of the board now again repeating the same pattern as we did on the other side slide in lockdown fully secured you here's our battery terminal connection that we can press firmly down to secure it onto the board and we can settle down our two coaxial cable connections here on this side as well you our tiny ribbon connection for the dock port and the two Phillips screws that secure the battery terminal down we are now going to position our protective tape over top of our secured connections let's make sure that our adhesive for our volume buttons on the side of the phone is holding it securely in place let's not forget our final two coaxial cable connections for the top board we can finally set in the plastic cover over top of the smaller board bringing in the rear cover for reinstallation along with the power button be patient with the power button and works slowly to try to keep it in its housing as you made it back down with the display assembly once you have the first of a couple of the clips secured then you can begin to work around the perimeter of the phone securing it down into place once the display is flush all the way around the perimeter of the phone we're in the homestretch let's bring in the six securing screws the two Phillips in the top portion of the phone and the four Torx screws down on the bottom you we're going to reinstall our existing grills so we're gonna use a small amount of heat to soften up the adhesive for their reinstallation position them down and press firmly into place you we can now reinstall the microSD and SIM card trays and power the phone on to check for full functionality and there you have it another successful repair by repairs universe calm all of the replacement parts and tools that you've seen in this video today are available at

      "title": "BEST HTC One M8 Screen Repair, Charging Port Fix, COMPLETE",
      "transcript": "Alright today we’re going to take apart\nthe HTC M8; the one with the two cameras on the back. Go ahead and turn the phone completely off. Grab a heat gun or a hair dryer and just heat\nup the phone gently on the top and the bottom. We’re not trying to heat up the screen,\nwe’re just trying to heat up the little metal plates that cover the ear piece and\ncamera. Once they are warmed up, just take a little\nrazor blade and slide it underneath the metal plate. Make sure not to put the razor blade down\ntowards the phone because there is some stuff under there that you can damage. So lift up these metal plates. Doesn’t matter if you damage them; they\nare pretty cheap and inexpensive to replace. There are four T5 torques heads screws down\nat the bottom and two normal Philips heads screws up at the top. Tools and parts will be listed down in the\nvideo description below. Take out the SIM card, there are probably\ntwo on your phone so take out both SIM card trays before you start to pry the back off\nof the device. I have taken my razor blade because it’s\na small, thin little tool that can slide in-between the screen and the back plate and unlatch\neach little clasp that holds the screen and frame into the back plate itself. It is a pretty big pain trying to get this\nthing apart. It is not easy. I did take a little bit of heat and heat up\nthe back of the phone as well just in case there’s some adhesive back there holding\nthe screen onto the metal frame itself. The whole take-apart process took about 10\nor 15 minutes. So go slow and take your time as you’re\npulling that back plate off. Here’s the back plate itself. You can see the little screw holes and the\ncamera lenses. There is a glass camera lens up for the top\ncamera; so if that breaks you’re just going to have to pop it out of its little slot and\nreplace it from the inside. Take off the tape that’s holding down the\nribbon cable connectors. There are two of those. Make sure you put this in a spot where it\nwon’t get damaged because you will want to put it back on the phone again when we’re\ndone. Lift up each of these little white clasps. They can break so be very careful as you’re\nlifting them up. Probably use a little plastic tool. And then you can just slide the little ribbon\ncables out from the little clasp itself once it’s lifted up. Pretty straight forward. You can just watch as I’m doing it here\nin the video. Once again all replacement parts and tools\nwill be found in the video description below. You can grab these little wire cables and\nlift them up. These ones are attached down towards the charging\nport. Then this one right here along the side as\nwell. There are some more ribbon cables up here\nat the top. This is the most ribbon cables I’ve even\nseen in a phone so congratulations HTC. There are two screws holding down the battery\nconnector to the motherboard. So just lift that up and you can see it’s\njust kind of like a little Lego connection; once you lift it up, it’s unsnapped. There are three screws holding on the motherboard\nto the frame so take those out. Two more wire cables up at the top. And the motherboard will slide away from the\nphone. So here’s the motherboard. It’s got the qualcromm processor in it as\nwell as all the memory and RAM and everything else that your phone needs to work. None of it is user replaceable. So unless you have some pretty complex soldering\ntools you’re just out of luck. Here is the loud speaker which is user replaceable. It’s got just a little ribbon cable connector\nthat plugs into the motherboard. And once again the parts will be listed in\nthe video description below. Just like the charging port, lucky for us,\nis replaceable. Usually one of the things that goes out first\non a device. The headphone jack is also included with this\npart as well which is nice. Battery comes out fairly easily. There’s a little bit of adhesive that holds\nit to the LCD so be careful when you’re sliding your pry tool underneath because all\nof the pressure is going on the LCD as well and if you’re planning on reusing your screen\nyou want to be gently. Make sure you pull away those volume rockers\nas well so you don’t damage that cable when you’re pulling the battery out. Here’s the battery. It’s a 2600 milliamp. Pretty decent size for a cell phone. Replacement batteries, hopefully, will be\nfound in the video description as well. Four screws holding down the daughter board. And if you’re smart you’ll take out the\nlittle screw holding the camera in as well. So when you pull that away from the board\nit’ll come with it. Remove the SIM card ribbon cable as well as\nthe front facing camera ribbon cable and the vibrator motor plug. You just want to unplug that from the device\nitself. So the power button up here at the top is\nheld down in a little slot so slide that up and out. And it is also connected to the top of the\nfront facing camera; so the grounding strap. So make sure you pull that off as well. Front facing camera comes away once the motherboard\nis away from the phone…daughter board, sorry. It’s a 5 megapixel camera. And then here’s the camera, the dual camera,\non the back of the phone. It’s probably in a metal case because any\nvariation of distance would mess up the depth perception feature that the camera is used\nfor with the phone. So it’s a pretty unique little thing that\nHTC has going on. There is the ear piece and now here is the\nreplacement screen. See the screen comes with the metal frame\nas well as the two replacement brackets that go over the front facing camera and the bottom\nspeaker. So if your replacement screen does not come\nwith all of this stuff, you probably bought the wrong piece and you’re going to want\nto get the whole replacement kit. Because the glass only repair is a completely\ndifferent repair and very very very difficult. Now to put the phone back together I clasp\nthe rear facing camera into the motherboard first…the daughter board. And then set that into place along with the\nfront facing camera. Just plug those little ribbon cable connectors\nin like Legos. Slid the power button back into its slot and\ngrounded it on top of the front facing camera again. And now I’m plugging back in the SIM card\ntray. So remember there’s this one and one more\non the other side so be very careful when you are plugging those back in. Get the vibrator motor plugged in. If you are replacing your screen you’ll\nprobably need to transfer the vibrator motor over from your old screen to your new one. Don’t forget to do that unless you don’t\nlike vibrations. Get those 5 screws plugged into the daughter\nboard. And the battery can go back into place. Make sure you have all of the ribbon cables\non the correct side of the battery. You don’t want to be looking for those later\non when you’re trying to put it all back together again. Get the charging port back into place; really\npleased that this is user replaceable. It’s nice that HTC made it easy for us. Lift up the rear camera a little bit when\nyou’re sliding the motherboard back into place. It does need to be sitting on top of the motherboard. Then grab the ribbon cable connectors, plug\nthem in and just latch each one of them down individually. Make sure they’re pressed in as far as they\ncan go. There are little tabs on each of the little\nribbon cables that you can use to press in and plug it into the little slot. And these little wire cable connectors, make\nsure it’s seated correctly on top of the little plug before you press it all the way\nin. Three screws on the motherboard. Plugging some more wire cables in…battery\ncable…clasp it in like a little Lego. Get those two screws back in place as well. It’s really important that you keep your\nscrews organized obviously. They’re all different sizes so keep them\ngrouped together. Maybe label them on a piece of paper as you’re\ntaking the phone apart. Pretty straight forward with all these little\nribbon cables….plug them in, latch them down and keep on going. This is a short stubby little guy so you got\nto kind of wiggle him into place and then use the extra tabs and maybe some leverage\nso you can plug them back in and have him stay there. Get the little wire cables pressed back into\nplace. Make sure you’re seated correctly. You don’t want to bend the little connection\non the main board cuz once that’s bent you don’t have a second chance. So get it on there and press it into place\nand you’re good to go. I’m going to test my screen before I put\nthe back plate on because that is honestly the hardest part of this repair; getting that\nback plate on and off. Looks like my screen is good to go. The touch sensitivity works, the color looks\nfine. If you have any lines or anything else on\nyour screen, test the connections first. If they are still there after all the connections\nare good, then you probably have a bad screen. Get the tape back into place over those ribbon\ncable connectors. And then I had a problem with my power button\nfalling out. I don’t know if that’s going to be an\nissue with everybody but just make sure that’s placed well into the frame. And then start with the charging port end\nof the phone and then once that’s pressed in you can press the rest of the phone in\nplace. My power button fell out again but after some\nconvincing I got it back into place. And snap the screen back into the metal frame. And you can see it snapped in fairly well. You can hardly tell that the phone has been\ntaken apart. Make sure to screw it back in. Bottom 4 screws and the top two screws. Now here’s the cool part…these are the\nreplacement metal pieces for the top and bottom of the phone. They’re actually really inexpensive so it’s\nprobably worth your time to buy the replacement ones instead of trying to make the old ones\nwork. They come with their own adhesive which is\nreally nice. Just take it, press it into place. I usually line it up with the bottom of the\nscreen and just snap the rest of it into place fairly easily. Pretty straight forward. I did find out that the lens from my first\npiece and second metal piece was different so I had to take off the front facing camera\nlens from the old screen and then use the new screen pieces to just set over the top\nof that and it worked a lot better. You can see the old camera lens just sitting\nthere on the bottom. But since it has a new one it’s just fine. Make sure there’s no dust or anything down\ninside of that when you’re putting it back together. Get the SIM cards in place. And there you go. Once again all parts and tools and everything\nthat you’ll need will be found in the video description below. Don’t forget to “like” if this video\nhelped you and don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks a ton for watching. Hope to see you around.",

      "transcript": "FX easy.com bringing you a repair video today on an LG Nexus 5 in today's video we're going to show you the steps necessary to remove and replace the display assembly on your Nexus before we get started with our disassemble let's review our suggested tools small Phillips screwdriver plastic opening tools a spudger fine tipped curved tweezers Precision knife set a heat gun or a blow dryer let's go ahead and begin our entry into our Nexus 5 reviewing the phone you're going to recognize that the seam around the perimeter is quite tight we could have tacked the seam with the plastic opening tool but we chose not to going towards the headphone jack initially with our exacto knife so that we can keep from marring the outside cover releasing the first clip and then continuing on with our plastic opening tool around the entire phone releasing all clips we then brought in a spudger to release the center portion of our rear cover so that we can remove it from our Nexus with our rear cover removed we can bring our attention to getting to the internal parts near our motherboard start with removing the protective plate on top of the motherboard with our six Phillip screws with our screws removed we can utilize our spudger to gently pry up this protective plate next there's a series of connections we want to disconnect start star in with our battery gently prying that up with our spudger then we're going to move on to our dock Port connector again peeling it up with our spudger over here in the top corner is going to be our front-facing camera and our last connection here is going to be the rear-facing camera that we can gently pry up we're going to bring in a set of tweezers to disconnect the two Co axle connections at either corner of the motherboard with all of our connections removed we should now be able to maneuver our motherboard away from the Nexus be careful not to snag it on any of the connections on its way out with our motherboard out of the way let's go ahead and put our replacement part next to our Nexus so that we can compare the two you'll notice that our replacement part has a lot of the housings and framework that our Nexus that we're disassembling has you'll see our front-facing camera here as well as the earpiece speaker our headphone jack and our rear-facing camera if you pick up the replacement part and really take a look at the framework you'll notice the housings for the power and volume buttons along the side as well at this point what you would be doing is is transplanting your components from the old broken display assembly over to the new replacement part our unit at this time is not broken we will not be swapping out the displays but I'll still show you how to remove and Transplant the components as if we were let's go ahead and start off with the headphone jack since it's easily lifted out of its housing next is going to be the earpiece speaker which we gently pry up using our tweezers our front-facing camera is going to be next in line and then our rear facing camera we can go ahead and peel up as well we can bring in our spudger to go ahead and get under that battery and peel it up from its location let's go ahead and remove the four Phillips screws that are securing the loud speaker and then remove it from the bottom of our Nexus we have a single connection here on our dock Port that we can pry up and then our COA axle cables on either side side let's go ahead and remove those from The Wire channels and now using our spudger let's get under that dock port and break away that adhesive that securing it in place so once again let's bring in our replacement part so we can compare the two with all of our components removed they are virtually identical for those of you that bought a replacement part that didn't come with a frame or a bezel to remove that original display assembly from the framework we bring in a heat gun or a blow dryer and heat up the adhesive to soften it up for removal we like to push through the front-facing camera hole with a screwdriver take a grip on the framework and then push it from the back side starting your separation in the top corner and then you can use a plastic opening tool to continue that separation and work yourself all the way around the perimeter of the framework before we get started with our reassembly let's go ahead and take a moment to speak to those that have purchased a replacement part that didn't come with framework or a bezel after removing your broken display assembly from the original framework you're going to have to utilize the adhesive strips that fixez.com sends with all of its replacement parts cutting it to size in shape utilizing a razor blade or scissors laying it in place accordingly and then reapplying your new replacement display assembly to the original framework so now let's go ahead and begin our reassemble starting with our dock port and running the co- axle cables on either side up into their channels and then finally locking down our display assembly connection firmly let's bring in some of our other components starting with our rear-facing camera first first followed by our earpiece speaker fitting snug in its housing our front-facing camera is next in line and then finally wrapping up with our headphone jack let's go ahead and bring in the battery and place it into the housing in the center of the phone now and then our loudspeaker is going to be next over top of our dogport securing it with the four Phillip screws maneuvering our motherboard around our connections and back into the Nexus a little hint for you start by positioning The Rocker button for the volume on the side of the motherboard let's go ahead and settle now all of our connections down into the motherboard starting with the front-facing camera the connection for the rear facing camera is next our connection for our battery and finally our connection here over top the battery for our dock port and do not forget the two co- axle cable connections at either corner of the motherboard let's bring in the plastic protective cover for the motherboard and secure it with the six Phillips screws we're in the home stretch now bringing in the rear cover when snapping in the rear cover I like to start with the bottom portion nearest to the dock port and then work my way around the perimeter snapping the Clips in firmly and then powering the phone on to check for full functionality and there you have it another successful repair by fix easy.com all of the parts

Make sure that things nice and solid so the tricky part here is then putting this this motherboard plate back on in place. CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

      "transcript": "I can take apart the new LG Nexus 5 if you look for parts or tools to repair the phone I will post whatever I can find in the description below so let's get started okay so with a plastic tool and it's important to use a plastic one or else you will scratch the edge of the phone a lot we're gonna go around the edge and work the clips just clips all along the side of the back and you want to work them out individually you don't want to pry the back off unless all the clips are loosened because you will put a big crease across your back so I was gonna fast forward this yeah as you can see I'm working each clip and I'm slowly pry in the back off there is a little bit of adhesive near the bottom and I might take a little bit more more strength to get it off but like I said don't bend the back door because you will put a crease in the sides and there we go now this is the back plate as you can see it houses some antenna cables the vibrator motor and whatnot close-up of this will show you the screws we're gonna remove one two three four five six and then there's three more at the bottom here four more actually to remove the bottom assembly that's the battery there so let's begin by removing these screws again I'm gonna fast-forward with a plastic tool or something to assist you you just lift that up and that's just a little cover for the motherboard first thing I disconnect here in the back is the battery plug so unplug the battery and the next thing is this is called the charger port flex cable assembly now if you want to change the charger port on the Nexus I love how they have made it very easy to do you don't have to do any soldering we would just replace this piece that is plugged in here once we remove the speaker I'll show you where it is and what it looks like so now let's go ahead and remove the four screws at the bottom so we can remove the speaker now this is a speaker assembly as a speaker also has an antenna here I'm not sure which one it is at this point but it's an antenna so now this is the flex cable for the charger port which also has a mic and a couple other little things along with it to move it we're gonna start by unclipping this antenna cable here okay as well as this flex cable here that's actually the LCD LCD or the digitizer as part of the screen assembly I forget which one it is at this point I'm pretty sure it's the LCD then we unplug the big antenna on the other side use a close-up you can see the charger port here the antenna cables and the plug that goes into the motherboard replacing this will also repair antenna issues if you're having antenna problems or reception ok so carefully you're gonna have to work it off carefully there's a bit of adhesive and the charger port is also inside the little plastic mount there you don't want to make put any rips in this whatsoever gets very narrow at one point here and that's where you gotta be very careful that rips very easy okay so here you don't want to pry it up in this case I'm gonna get a metal opening tool which is thinner and I'm actually gonna try to get underneath this cable here lifted up later and that's it now we're gonna remove the battery it's very easy to remove the battery in this case but actually we're gonna remove the motherboard first get that out of the way very you just you know unclip it there's gonna be some little bit of resistance but just work it carefully don't yank on anything and here's the motherboard let's take a closer look at it so you can see all the connectors there camera connector and all why not this is the back you got the SIM card slot the GPU or CPU and and yeah that's what the mandible looks like it's pretty small now the battery comes off very easy it has a bit of adhesive but just a quick snap with the opening tool they'll come right off and here's the camera we'll get that off as well I've got a bit of two-way tape to hold it on and that's good to go here's the battery it's not a bad little battery I forget I think it's twenty three hundred million bowers and this is the front screen assembly if you're gonna replace the screen I would recommend getting it like this however you can replace just the LCD in glass without the frame in this case we're not gonna remove the screen from the frame just put it back together we put the battery back in put the camera back on I'm gonna troll the motherboard back on sorry about that so we'll put the motherboard back on carefully make sure the Flex cables go over top clip in everything try not to clip in the battery first clip and everything else and usually you don't want to put power on the motherboard and to live as you know the last thing you wanted but in the charge report plug in that screen and we'll put in the antenna cable back on sorry about this angle you can't really see anything as you can see I'm plugging it in they'll be easier to put it back together if you make sure that antenna cable follows a little the little outline it has there so we'll plug in the charging port cable plug in the headphone jack cable and the little antenna cable here plug it in there plugged in perfect now you plug in the battery and you also install the the speakers and we'll be back at the bottom the four screws in of course we're gonna put this back plate back on and install all the screws as well I'm going to fast forward this too the fast forwarding is coming I hope oh come on I hope I'm surprised I didn't fast forward of this this is awkward I am doing the voiceover so obviously you know forgot to fast-forward but anyways yeah just put all the screws in okay now we're ready to put the back on and then we're good to go very easy it just snaps back and just go around the edge make sure it's snug and there you go okay so hope this helped somebody if you're looking to take apart your phone or replace the battery or anything the screen and if you have any questions just send me an email thanks for watching",

      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another video and in today's video where we take a look at this twelve dollar and fifty cent iPhone 5c then picked up on eBay now as you can see from the photo there that it is totally smashed the LCD is cracked and the screen itself is also smashed so you can see here it is it's green now the first thing I did was back up this iPhones an encrypted backup and the screen actually trusted my computer somehow it sort of glitched through the home screen and into the calculator app at one point but you can see there it is totally shattered and the digitizer is completely unresponsive so I can't unlock it or do anything like that so I've gone ahead and shut it off by holding the power and home button and I'm gonna go ahead and put a brand new screen on this now I picked this up so cheap because it actually is iCloud activation locked now it has another passcode on it and the reason I can tell that is if you look up the top of an iPhone that isn't passcode locked you'll actually see a little grabber tab full control center and Notification Center if you see those the phone itself is not passcode locked unless it is running iOS 7 then is a possibility seems that iOS 7 is quite old now to date most phones won't be running a version of iOS 7 anyway so there's a good indicator the phone has no passcode now sure enough iCloud is on so I will have to try and get that removed but I will talk a little bit about that later so basically installing a screen on this isn't very hard at all I just took the old one off and you can see there it's definitely not a genuine Apple screen as it has a sticker on the cable itself so it's been it replaced at some point basically not a very hard process at all basically the hardest part would probably be putting on the camera assembly and everything again because trying to put those screws in there it's a bit difficult when the speaker contains a magnet and it just keeps sucking these screws towards the magnet itself but you can see here didn't take very long at all and quite a quick process to do now you also got to remove is metal shield as well to reinstall onto the new screen most new screens don't come with the home button and the camera assembly and things like that but if you can get one I advise doing so just keep in mind if you've got a 5s or later that you'll need to swap over your home button or you won't get touch ID but this is a 5c so that's not an issue which is great at your home button breaks and you don't have to worry about touch ID not working because these phones didn't ship with touch ID anyway the metal plate itself wouldn't fit at first it seemed that the screen itself was slightly smaller or something so I had to get my spudger in there and just sort of Bend those metal tabs out a little bit so I could get that metal shield reinstalled into this screen itself so go ahead and put all the screws back into the new screen the new screen itself cost more from the phone but I got a decently good quality screen here I actually haven't brought off this seller before and I can report that it was a very good screen I got that from ebay oh if you're getting a new screen for a phone I wouldn't go for the cheapest screen that you can buy unless you're just using it maybe just to test out the phone itself or whatever if you're going to be changing a screen at least go sort of mid-range because you don't want to get those screens that don't actually work properly and that just a nightmare because you end up having to return them because they don't work properly or they have lines in them or the color is really bad but other than that this was relatively easy to do and didn't take very long at all now after you've done that I just went ahead and cleaned around the edge of the phone itself just to remove any dirt inside the phone then I could go ahead and plug in the new screen and go ahead and hold down the power button here and make sure everything's working you can see there no more cracked LCD and we can actually see what's going on on the screen itself so once the phone turns on you can see here we've got slide to unlock and like I said those little grabbers or whatever you want to call them the top and the bottom are there which means this phone had no passcode and you can see I got straight into the phone and it's a 32 gigabyte iPhone 5c green running iOS nine point three point four now that I can confirm the screen wax and go ahead and install the LCD bracket plate to stop the connectors from coming unplugged and also the battery bracket as well now for some reason Apple doesn't make all the screws magnetic this is one screw on just about every generation of iPhone that isn't magnetic it is the longer screw and it's probably why they do it so you don't muddle it up and put the screws in the wrong holes which can in turn entirely break the phone and board-level replacements and repairs and all that kind of stuff see make sure you lay the screws out in a way that you can know where everything goes I usually lay the screws out next to the components they come from so I know exactly what hole they come from and what component they come from as well so I don't end up putting any screws in the wrong place and damaging any of a logic board or screen or anything else so once you've gone ahead and done all that and go ahead and put the screen back onto the 5c and clip it down and put the bottom screws into the iPhone and then we're ready to test out the iPhone itself okay so powering on the phone again you can see that this time the screen is installed but yet again everything is working fine and a good test when you get a new screen is to drag an icon or just move your finger around on the screen and make sure all parts of the digitizer are responsive and then I just tested out some basic features such as the camera app just to make sure the camera is aligned and working which it was now this phone itself is iCloud lock like I said so it has an iCloud account linked into it now I did get in contact with the original owner or the account owner on this Find My iPhone account and he said that he had recycled the phone at office works which is like a sort of way to buy an estate you know like rulers and stuff that's sort of like a stationary shop we didn't have one here where I live but there's one couple of hours awake I didn't know they recycle phones it turns out the guy put it off on eBay has just got it out of a firm recycling bin and sold it on eBay for $12 which I don't see much of a profit myself but twelve bucks not bad so anyway with the new screen and everything it was a very cheap 5c like I said I got in contact with the owner of the Apple ID and he basically removed it from his account or he did something I'm not sure what he's done but basically when I turn it off you know I'd shut it down because it didn't seem to do anything he said he had uh had remotely wiped it I went ahead and piled the phone back on and you can see put it straight into the hello screen and you can see their activation what pops up I'm sorry always gonna do now he's removed from his account and the phone will be able to activate now you can see here it goes straight to the activation lock screen and a weird thing it literally just asked me to sign in with the iTunes Store D and it actually says his email right there now I actually knew the email anyway so that wasn't anything exciting but I thought it was kind of funny that it's asking you to sign into the iTunes Store on the activation lock screen that shouldn't happen that is a bug because theoretically Apple's not supposed to be providing the email address of a locked iphone if you want to see if I got this point unlocked or not make sure you go ahead and check out my Twitter link will be down in the description I post a lot of things on there about things that don't actually make it to videos and behind the scenes on my videos as well so I'll post on my Twitter about the iPhone 5c if I get it unlocked or if I don't get in laughter whatever happens to the 5c I should be getting it unlocked nevertheless but I hope you guys enjoyed this video you want to see more videos just like this one go ahead and check out the iPhone playlist link will also be down in the description and I hope you guys enjoy this video and I'll catch you guys next time no one of my great videos",

      "transcript": "what's up guys it's frog for dog an ominous box that has been shipped to me today let's find out what's inside that wasn't satisfying enough hold on hold on hold on let's find out what's inside that's better all right there we go open it up okay it's a screen it's a replacement screen for an iPhone 5c so no refund will be given if the flux cables have been damaged uh if the protective film has been removed all right well here we go actually it seems that almost everything's in here we just gotta swap a few things over warranty void damaged hmm interesting okay let's get our replacement victim here it is it's an iPhone 5c uh it was one that I tried to do a screen swap with already uh the screen didn't work to begin with but also I I applied pressure to the corner and it kind of destroyed the screen please do not apply pressure to the corners of the LCD panel it cracked it the screen was already broken I didn't realize until I actually installed it I know this one is an iCloud locked even though it had a screen on it before that was kind of screwed I did reset it and it's not iCloud locked so we're going to replace the screen on this and hopefully get a working 5c I'm not gonna be looking it up we're just gonna go in there do some surgery and hit this guy's face off and pull out his organs and tear them apart look at that there's no there's no screws on here so I have to poach them from another phone which phone I poked them from I don't know but that means we can go straight to ripping the face off I have a variety of suction cups in here and I already know I'm gonna have to pull this up from the bottom because I've been on this phone about three times now oh geez yep there's all the broken glass yeah yeah now the mid frame is also destroyed so I might have to pull apart my other 5c look at that the glass is falling apart on this one I am going to clean this up foreign we're in okay so now we're going to take apart these screws here and can you believe it that Phillips head screws and an iPhone can you believe it that was once a thing even up to like I'd say the iPhone 6. oh my hands are a bit shaky I literally just woke up uh before I go and try and shake that screw out that went to fall back in we're just gonna take out the screen there we go there's one ribbon cable there's two and hold it hold it there's three and we're just gonna tap this out right there it is that's the screw all right and now we can immediately just test the uh new screen by just plugging it in and uh hoping for the best all right we've got a little power brick here a little tiny one and we have this very fancy lightning cable which we'll plug in in a bit okay well right off the bat the foam is completely and utterly misaligned this is what happens when you buy replacement parts off eBay uh this is the kind of quality you get um so this one plugs into here all right that's that so yeah we'll just we'll just kind of leave it like that it's kind of hanging open a little bit a little bit sketch all right so here we have this fancy schmancy lightning cable and you'll see why it's fancy once I plug it in oh look at that the end glows and that's all it does that's all that's special about it okay plugging it in are you serious are you serious like this phone literally worked well it's definitely doing something because the phone is getting hot let's be real what oh okay it's it's shipped it's shipped broken are you serious so they shipped me a screen but the screen's broken maybe it's just a bad faulty connection let's oh actually no it is a faulty connection aha see that's gonna plug it in properly and there we go oh no if these things are on iOS 10 we will need a home button which uh or maybe I could just like press the contacts here oh my god it works it works so actually you can just on these other phones you can just jump these two pins and get a home button all right so we're gonna leave this here and we're just gonna let it charge and I'll get back to you once it turns back on okay well the screen seems to be on and yeah it needs to be plugged in properly I press home to open all right and we're in yeah it's a bit blurry but that's because the connection is really bad oh my God that's that's I've never seen a screen freak out this badly before oh no it's getting worse it's actually getting way worse there's a battery life on their work yes it does alright so I complained to the guy on eBay and we're gonna get a new screen for free so that's cool um in the meantime I might as well just try putting this thing together we've got the home button placed back on but as you can see the screen is pretty much stuffed anyway the touch doesn't work it's pretty much always been doing that obviously auto brightness works but just but I get to do the really cool fun moment everyone everyone's been waiting for oh look at that look at just how new that looks isn't that so beautiful with how Colleen it is it's never gonna stay like this so might as well wear it a little bit oh oh wow that looks terrible unfortunately it is what it is but we have a new screen coming anyway so hopefully that deals with that that doesn't work then I don't know it's kind of failed so we'll go to when we get our next screen replacement which will be in a few days all right well it is I need to clean my camera look at that holy crap okay that's way better all right so it's been several days since I've tried to do a screen pair and we've got this a brand new replacement screen hopefully this time this one actually works so yeah let's just give it a shot We're not gonna plug it in before we do it we're just gonna do a normal repair and then turn it on and we'll see if it works please use our return postage this package to send your faulty item back to us yep I sure will let's begin as better we can actually have a grippy surface we can actually unscrew these things safely on how good are you I will very much enjoy doing these screws again oh interesting this new screen has no uh foam on the connectors so that's um I don't know if that's concerning or yeah hmm it's all loudspeaker foreign they're not two different sizes surely and that was a bit dumb but they wouldn't be that dumb that my friends is the home button and that's the plastic bit of the home button and that is the screen uh it's the old screen that we're gonna mail back to them yeah we ship this screen back to them and hopefully uh get my refund or something at least okay all right so now we're going to start swapping everything over we're gonna go on this angle just so I can actually look in closely and there's also a method camera seems to line up a lot better now even the long screws are pretty tough to get in actually no they're not there easy all right that's actually pretty quick so we have transferred the camera and earpiece module ready to be using the iPhone home button not back in okay so now the home button has been reinstalled and it works so now we're ready with well actually I have to put these screws back in they go on upside down you just gotta flip them around without dropping them it's a lot easier said than done and then the softness of your finger actually likes to pull them back out and the magnets of your screwdriver like to pull the back out as well I wish I had like a screw demagnetizer that'd be very useful unfortunately we are approaching my least favorite part and that is trying to screw it into there because the way the screen is it's such a terrible system basically plugging this in and then putting this bracket on and then screwing it on but then when you as you screw it on this likes to come in more and more and more and more giving you less room and the screws keep falling out and yeah not fun but if you like human suffering by all means you'll love this part so now we need to have somebody hold this screen up what we will do is we'll try just screwing in the bottom two first I reckon I love like having a battery right there to puncture everything in case you know I just wanted to create a lithium file see it's not it's not the fact that it's like this you can rest the screen up like this if it's the fact that once you screw this back part in the screen starts falling forwards and it's constantly trying to fall onto you we've already got two screws in a matter of about like 10 seconds that's nuts I don't know what I was doing last time but I was losing it maybe because I've just learned patience in the last week or so actually I have should I go for the top one I reckon we might go for the top one I'm mainly going to attempt this a few times because I already know it's not exactly worth my time yeah see magnets magnets don't really want to help me out here but that's all right this keeps magnetizing to the tweezers who cares let's just Chuck it in if you're gonna break it at least break it on camera so you get content something something going in aha it's this this is shred up the wrong screw okay yeah some some of it's a bit bent some of it is a bit bent it's always like stuff like this that gets to the hottest part and then people get impatient and they press on the screen wrong and just cracks okay that's done iPhone moment of truth I guess let's plug this thing in and see if it works properly oh my God no way it might actually work all right we're gonna leave this charging you we'll see if the touchscreen works if it does we've got a successful repair all right so the phone's charged up and now it's booting up so let's see if it works oh okay we have touch response best time to open SIM card not installed okay yeah that seems to work yeah yeah control center all right we have a working iPhone here and it's not even iCloud locked so that's that's great also I'm really digging the uh 5c the white 5c with the black screen it's got this nice like panda look to it I do like the colors as well but this just so happens to be one the one that I got 16 gig model nice nice very cool everything seems to work just fine uh let's see how bright this gets okay not bad not bad has pretty good viewing angles yeah if you do get a replacement screen I believe the best thing to do is just to test like how even the backlight slash colors are are the viewing angles but it seems to be working just fine the touch responsiveness is also pretty good yeah I would say that this is a success it's not a success it's a five scene but it's a success sorry yeah totally original joke here's something I didn't film but I bet you all want to see that is the peel it's so cool to see one of these in like pristine condition can you believe it guys a successful repair on frog for dog this is this is insane so yeah my name is frog for dark you can say that however you want I really don't care more videos whenever I want yeah uh that's the end of the video thanks for watching foreign",

The display assembly is still connected to the logic board to get it completely off we're going to need to disconnect all the cables. Before we get to those we have to remove the cable bracket which is held in place by four Phillips screws. With the display assembly free we can move on to the next step which is disconnecting the battery even though our phone is powered down it's a good idea to completely disconnect any power sources before continuing any repair. The battery connector is located right below the battery connector bracket which is held in place by two Phillips screws. Using the plastic opening tool gently pry the logic board up and out of the phone. There is an antenna cable that is still attached to the board on the underside.

      "title": "iPhone 5c Cracked Screen Repair in 3 minutes",
      "transcript": "All right, today I’m going to show you how\nto replace the iPhone 5c screen in three minutes. First of all, just take out the bottom screws. These are the same size screws as all the\nother iPhones, so any of those Pentalobe screwdrivers will work. There’s two screws right next to the charging\nports. Take those out. The second step is a little bit harder. You need a suction cup and a plastic pry tool,\nso lift up with a suction cup and just kind of twist your pry tool in there to lift up\nthe screen out of the bottom latches. Once it’s lifted up gently pry the screen\naway from the body and the other latches along the side of the screen will pull up as well. Be very careful with the screen, especially\nif it’s broken or cracked. Next there’s four screws along this plate. There are three different sizes so make sure\nwhen you take the screws out you’re going to remember where they go when you have to\nreassemble the phone later. Once this metal plate is off, there are four\nmetal latches that you have to lift up. They’re kind of like Legos. So just kind of pry up and unsnap them one\nby one. Technically you don’t have to do the one\non the bottom left, that’s the one that’s attached to the battery. I got a little carried away and decided to\ndo it anyway. Anyway, once the three important ones are\nunlatched your screen is off. Now, depending on where you get your screen\nyou might have a few more steps. You might have to take the home button and\nreplace it, and replace this back panel as well. But all you have to have to do is loosen up\nthose screws and transfer it right over to the new screen. Once you’ve done that, you can take the\nlatches, the little ribbing cables, and snap them into place just like Legos. Be very very gentle with these because if\nyou rip them, you will have problems. One of them does go over to the earpiece so\nyou might need to swap that over as well just depending on where you get your screen. Amazon usually has the cheapest screens so\nI will list them in the video description below as soon as they become available. Take your four screws that you kept organized\nearlier, and pop them into place. Screwing them in. This is just your regular Phillips screwdriver. And then make sure the top is aligned and\nsnap the screen gently into place. There will be a series of satisfying clicks\nas you press the phone back together again. And as you see the phone is completely back\ntogether, and it looks exactly like new. There is no raise in the screen, it is all\nflush just like it was before. Don’t forget to put your bottom two screws\nback in and you are set. If you have any questions, make sure to leave\nthem in the comments below. Don’t forget to like if this video helped\nyou and don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching.",

      "title": "iPhone 5s battery replacement in 6 minutes!",
      "transcript": "All right, today we're going to take out the\nbattery in the iPhone 5s. First take your Pentalobe screwdriver, the\nsame screwdriver that's used for all of the iPhones, and take out the two screws near\nthe base. Then take your suction cup and put it as close\nto the home button as possible. And take a metal pry tool or anything that's\nsturdy enough to fit between the glass screen and the metal frame. I like to use a razor blade just because of\nhow firm it is. It doesn't bend around and it makes sure that\nthe screen comes up when in control. So you can see I'm just barely prying it up\nvery very gently right here, and then I'm going to switch to a plastic tool to not damage\nthe frame or the screen. And you have to very careful when you're lifting\nit up because there is a little ribbon cable attached to the home button that you can see\nright here, and there is a little clasp that you have to lift up. It's just like a little latch so I'm going\nto get my little pry tool in there and just clip it up. You can see it bend back just like a little\ndoor. And the whole little thing comes off, you\ncan see that it'll detach itself as soon as I get the ribbon cable un-clipped. It's just kind of like a LEGO. So I lift up and away from the bottom and\nit unsnaps. And now we're going to take off the screen\njust so we don't damage it while we're removing the battery. It's pretty simple, there's just four screws\naround the outside of the little metal bracket. I'm undoing each of those right now. Make sure not to bend the screen past ninety\ndegrees or it will damage the cables. Any parts that you need for those will be\ndown in the video description below, tools batteries, if you need anything else just\nask me in the comments, I usually respond pretty quick. So now I'm going to take off these three ribbon\ncable connectors. This one's for the speaker on the screen. This next one is for the LCD on the screen,\nand then this last one is for the digitizer on the screen, which is the part where you\ntouch and it recognizes where your finger is. Now the screen is off, you can just kind of\nsee the back of it here. You have the earpiece with your cameras and\neverything, and then you have your fingerprint sensor on the home button. Now take out the battery. There are two screws holding on this metal\nbracket that holds the battery connector in place. So I'm going to take off this screw. Keep it separate from the other screws you\ntook off it earlier cause they are different lengths. And I'm going to remove this bracket and set\nit next to the screws so I know which one goes in which hole. And I'm going to take my pry tool and lift\nup on the little latch, you can see the three pin connector right there. And now I flip the phone around and I'm going\nto start prying down from the top of the battery. Just kind of using the frame as leverage and\npushing my pry tool underneath the battery so I'm not doing a whole lot of pulling up\non the frame or the back, I'm more just sliding the tool underneath. And that un-sticks it from the two strands\nof sticky tape that you'll see here in just a second. Then just kind of wiggle the battery loose\nand the battery is now free from the iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c battery is\ninterchangeable. I will list the iPhone 5s battery below though\nbecause it is the bigger battery, it will last longer. Anyway, press it down into place inside the\nphone, make sure it's completely flat. And put the three-pin connector back into\nplace and the metal bracket back on top. Screwing it back in. If you have any questions you can either leave\nthem in the comments or you can always hit me up on Twitter or Facebook, I'll put links\nat the end of the video for that. Now we're going to reattach the screen, starting\nwith the digitizer cable. Just kind of clip that into place. It's just kind of like Legos. You'll just have to position it with your\nfinger and then you'll hear a snap as it goes in. Be gentle though. We want to break the least amount of stuff\npossible when we open these phones up. Hopefully nothing. You can see me struggle a little bit with\nthis last one, it's takes a second to figure out where the connection actually is. And then I'm going to put the bracket back\ninto place, grabbing each of the screws that I laid out before, remembering where they\nwent, I usually lay the screws out around the bracket next to the hole they go in. Once again any parts for this can be found\nin the video description below. Amazon is usually the cheapest place to get\nbatteries and stuff, so I'll put a link there. Now the fun part. The little ribbon cable for the thumb print\nreader or finger print reader is pretty hard to get back into place. You have to line it up kind of with your finger\nfirst and then take your plastic pry tool and just kind of gently press it into place. It takes a while, you're going to love it. So now that that's clicked in you have your\nlittle bracket and you set that into place just sitting kind of on top of it. Make sure it's oriented in the right direction,\nand you can press it or click it back down into place with your finger. Takes a second to get it all lined up. And that's what it looks like when it's all\npressed down into place, so it'll clip in on both sides and hold that ribbon cable in\nvery securely. Then line the top of the screen up with the\nframe and kind of clip it up on the sides, being careful not to press it too hard in\nthe center of the screen, we don't want to crack it. And it will clip back into place. And you can see that it's completely flush\nwith the phone again. And then at this point I like to turn it on\njust to make sure everything's working so I don't have to jump back in, just in case\nI forgot to connect any cables or anything like that. If you have any questions, make sure to leave\nthem in the comments section below, and then also don't forget to get those bottom two\nscrews in. I put up videos pretty regularly.

And the whole little thing comes off, you can see that it'll detach itself as soon as I get the ribbon cable un-clipped. It's just kind of like a LEGO. So I lift up and away from the bottom and it unsnaps. And now we're going to take off the screen just so we don't damage it while we're removing the battery. There are two screws holding on this metal bracket that holds the battery connector in place. Keep it separate from the other screws you took off it earlier cause they are different lengths. And I'm going to take my pry tool and lift up on the little latch, you can see the three pin connector right there. And that un- sticks it from the two strands of sticky tape. that you'll see here in just a second. Then just kind of wiggle the battery loose and the battery is now free from the iPhone 5s. Now we're going to reattach the screen, starting with the digitizer cable. Just kind of clip that into place. Any parts for this can be found in the video description below. Amazon is usually the cheapest place to get batteries and stuff, so I'll put a link there. finger. Takes a second to get it all lined up. Then line the top of the screen up with the frame and kind of clip it up on the sides. And you can see that it's completely flush with the phone. Facebook.com/CNN iReport.

      "title": "iPhone 5s Screen Repair done in 11 minutes. Best video.",
      "transcript": "You're going to need a small Phillips head\nscrewdriver and then a Pentalobe screwdriver. It's the same size that opens up all of the\niPhones. Then you need a pry tool and a suction cup. Put the suction cup close to the home button. Take your Pentalobe screwdriver and undo the\nbottom two screws right next to the charging port. Place your suction cup right next to the home\nbutton and lift up with your finger at the same time, trying to put the pry tool between\nthe frame and the screen. I've found it a little bit easier to use a\nrazor blade, as it was more firm so it could slide down between the frame and the glass\neasier. Lift it up gently, kind of pry them apart. Don't stick your tool in too far, though,\nbecause there's a ribbon cable that you don't want to rip. Lift up gently between the screen and the\nframe. And you can see right here, that little ribbon\ncable, that's where the fingerprint sensor connects to the main board. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take\nmy little pry tool, reach it in there, and it's kind of of like a little latch, so you\ntwist your pry tool up a little bit, it will unlatch on one side, and it will come apart. Here in a second you'll see as I lift up the\nlittle ribbon cable and unsnap it the top part of the latch comes off. Which is fine, it goes back on pretty easily\nas well. When I say easily I mean you're going to hate\nevery second of it towards the end of the video. Right here on this bracket there's going to\nbe four screws. Take off each of the screws and then set them\nin the location where they came out. And then put the bracket right next to it\nso you remember where they go in. Because they are different sizes. There's the bracket. And then right here we have different ribbon\ncables, I'm going to unsnap them just like little LEGOs. This is for the earpiece and camera. This one right here is for the LCD. And then this one's the digitizer. Not that you really need to know what those\nare. But they unclip and unsnap just like that. Now here's the screen. We have the earpiece on this side with all\nthe cameras and the sensors, and we have the home button with the fingerprint sensor on\nthe bottom. I'm going to show you how to take apart that\nfirst. Undo the little screw. There's a little super tiny metal piece that\nshould stick to the screw as you unscrew it. Mine did. Just remember where that goes and the location\nof it so you can put it back in just in case it does pop off. Then there's two screws holding on the home\nbutton. There's a little metal bracket, so take that\noff. And then the home button itself is just kind\nof stuck on, like with sticky tape type stuff, onto the frame of the phone. So you can take any kind of pry tool, I like\nmy razor blade, I find that it is pretty stiff and sharp enough to get under these little\ntiny seams. Be super careful around these ribbon cables\nthough because if you rip one, you have to buy a new part. I'm going to show you how to gently pry up\naround the home button. Just a little bit on each side until the whole\nbutton comes away from the phone. Very gently. Any parts for this phone I'm going to list\nin the video description below, so if you have any questions or anything like that let\nme know, if you have a specific part you need, let me know and I can usually find it pretty\ncheap for you. There's the home button and now we're going\nto take off the earpiece as well as the front-facing camera and light sensor. So here's the two screws on either side of\nthe bracket there. And the bracket's kind of interesting. There's a little metal clip on the inside\nof the bracket that you have to bend just ever so slightly out so the bracket will come\noff. So I'm going to bend that out. And then the whole bracket comes away from\nthe phone. And you can kind of see what I was talking\nabout with the little tiny clip right there. So it very easily clips back into place when\nyou're done. Anyway, once again be super careful with all\nthese little ribbon cables. Apple didn't mess around when they were putting\nthem all into one component. Right here you can see I'm lifting up the\nconnector for the earpiece as well as the light sensor, and then you can see the camera\ncoming away as well in that same ribbon cable group. And then the whole thing is kind of stuck\ndown with the little grounding sticker onto the back of the screen. So peel up on that very gently. Once again you don't want to rip any of this\nstuff. The less you break when opening your phone,\nthe better. That's what I always say. There you go. Now it depends on where you buy your screen\nfrom but you might also have to switch out the metal plate, there's just those four screws\naround the outside. Now once again that's completely dependent\non where you get your screen from. I'm not going to do it on this screen, just\nbecause it is super simple. Four screws, pop it out, you're good to go. And now I'm going to place the group of ribbon\ncables, camera, sensor and everything back into place. There's only one spot for everything, so you\njust have to position it, it does take a little to get everything in the right spot. But they only fit in one way, so it's pretty\nsimple to figure out. Got it stuck back down onto the screen again. And then get the earpiece in there. Remember the earpiece acts as like a little\nmagnet. So, let's say you're trying to pick up a screw\nwith your screwdriver and your screwdriver's not magnetized, you can easily magnetize it\non the back of the speaker. I'll show you how to do that once I get this\nbracket into place. So my screwdriver won't pick up the screw,\nso I touch it to the back of the speaker and then boom, the screwdriver is magnetized. It will pick up any screw. Almost too well, so I'm going to grab it with\nmy tweezers instead and place it down into the hole \nand screw it back into place. Same thing with the other screw. And you are done with the earpiece. So the home button, remember this is where\nyou need to remember what direction that little tiny metal bit was going in. So get the home button pressed down into place. Get the bracket over the top of it. And then hopefully your screw is still stuck\nin to the top of the ribbon cable so you can just screw it down into place. I found that it was a little bit easier to\nhold it with my pry tool as well as the little screwdriver, like this. Finally got that thing screwed in again. And now we get the screen back on. I\"m going to start with the digitizer ribbon\ncable. I'm going to clip that into place once again\nit's just like LEGOs, you have to position it right over the top but once it's in place\nyou can just click it down. You'll hear a satisfying click with each connection. You'll see me struggle a little bit with this\nlast one. It's hard to find out exactly where it wanted\nto clip in. And there we go. Grab your little bracket, and once again you\nshould have your screws laid out in a way that you can remember where they went. I'm going to screw each one of those back\ninto place. Once again, any parts for this, you know,\nthe screen, anything else you might need will be listed in the video description below. And if you need anything else besides that\nmake sure to ask me in the comments or hit me up on Twitter, either way. Hit me up on Facebook and I can answer any\nquestions you have. Anyway, here's the fingerprint scanner cable\nthat we're going to try and get back into place. You're going to hate this thing. It never wants to do what you want it to do. So I kind of positioned it with my finger\nand then I have my pry tool and I'm going to press it in just like little LEGO snaps\nthat we were playing with before. Get it in place and then I have a little hinged\nbracket that I'm going to slip down on top of there as well. And once you get it into place you can press\nit down with your finger or with your pry tool. Once again it just takes forever to get this\nthing positioned just right. You're going to love Apple. Anyway, that's what it looks like when it's\nin place. And then position the top of the screen in\nfirst and you can kind of snap up the edge of the phone. Make sure to press only on the edges so you\ndon't crack the screen again. And then clip the bottom into place as well. And then at this point I like to turn the\nphone on to make sure it's working, so I don't have to undo the bottom screws more than I\nneed to. Looks like it all turns on so I'm going to\nget those bottom screws screwed back into place. Once again if you have any questions or comments\nor anything else make sure to leave them in the comments below, like this video if it\nhelped you and don't forget to subscribe. I get my hands on fairly new phones fairly\nquickly so you can see the guts of them as soon as soon as they come out. Hit me up on Google+, Twitter, and Facebook,\nI'd love to hear from you. And thanks for watching!",

      "title": "How to fix iPhone 5s Charging Port in 5 minutes",
      "transcript": "All right, today I'm going to show you how\nto replace the charging port on your iPhone 5s. It's a relatively simple process. There are two Pentalobe screws down here at\nthe bottom of the phone. There will be tools and parts listed down\nin the video description below. So go ahead and check there if you need to\nbuy a new charging port or if you need the tool kit for it. Lift up on your screen with a suction cup\nand then I use a razor blade to slide between the screen and the frame of the phone, and\nI also pry up just on the frame of the screen to make sure not to bend it or damage the\nLCD at all. The screen is really fragile so make sure\nyou only bend up around those metal clasps around the outside of the screen. There's a little metal piece attached to a\nribbon cable down here so lift that off, and then unattach the ribbon cable from that little\nclip down there at the bottom. It's similar to a Lego. So just unsnap that and the screen will lift\nup. Make sure not to fold it past 90 degrees,\notherwise you'll damage those ribbon cables. Take out the four screws that's holding down\nthe metal plate, lift off the plate and then there's three ribbon cables here attached\nto the main board, so just lift off each of those three little cables. Similar to Legos, just unsnap them. Once again tools and parts will be down in\nthe video description below, so check those out. Down here there is a bracket holding down\nthe battery connector. Take out those two screws, lift off the bracket,\nunconnect the battery, unconnect this little wire cable down here, and then unconnect the\ncable that goes to the charging port. There is also a little bit of glue that's\nholding it down as well so just fold that back. Make sure not to kink it too much. There are seven screws holding down the charging\nport, so just take off every single screw you see down there. Lift off the loudspeaker. You can see right here on the corner of the\nloudspeaker there's a little metal circle thing. That'll get lost really easily so make sure\nyou keep track of that and keep it where it's at. And then here you can see where the loudspeaker\nconnects to the charging port cable. Right now I'm disconnecting the headphone\njack and the microphone from the frame of the phone, you can just slide those away from\nthe frame of the phone. That way they won't get caught as you try\nto peel up the charging port from the phone. And I'll show you how to do that here in just\na second. You can see I'm using a pry tool to kind of\nscrape away the glue down at the bottom. Try not to kink the cable too much, and also\nbe careful where you pull on it as well because it can rip, so just make sure you pull it\naway from the phone gently. Just keep working at it. If you need to slide your plastic tool down\nin there some more you can, just make sure not to use a metal tool and you should be\nfine. Lifting it up and away from the phone. There are a few little metal parts attached\nto the ribbon cable as well, you can see this one kind of came loose as I was lifting it\noff, just put it back in place, lining it up with the screws so you're ready to put\nit back on when the time comes. Here's the charging port itself. If there are any parts that are on your old\ncharging port that aren't on your new one, you need to move them over. Like metal brackets, or even the little rubber\nboot down there by the microphone. Most charging ports will not come with that\nso just disconnect it from your old one. And then your new charging port should have\nsome adhesive that will hold it in place and allow you to snap it into the phone right\nhere on that little plastic bracket. Pretty straightforward. So now that I have the new charging port in\nplace I'm going to go ahead and pinch the earpiece and the microphone back into place\nkind of like where they were before. I'm going to screw that part in. And then that'll leave me enough room and\nenough places where I can maneuver the charging port to get the loudspeaker in place. I'm going to screw that as well just to hold\nit in place. And then I only have four screws left for\nthe actual charging port itself. Wire cable clicks in, battery cable clicks\nin, charging port cable clicks in, pretty straightforward. Similar to Legos like I mentioned before. And then you can take that metal bracket and\njust screw that down into place as well. So like I said, pretty simple repair. Not a whole lot to it. And then just getting that screen back into\nplace there's those three ribbon cable connectors right there as well. And remember any tools or parts that you need\nare always going to be in the video description. So check that out. Get the metal bracket back into place with\nthose four screws. And now this you're going to hate. This is the worst part, trying to get that\nlittle guy to snap back in that little hole again. As long as you get it to line up, you can\nclick it down like a little Lego. And then the metal bracket, it just wants\nto fly all over the place. So if you line up the back of it first in\nthe little grooves, then you can pinch down the front. It's kind of like a little door. Like a little latch that you can snap down\ninto place. Then line up the top of the screen with the\nframe of the phone. And make sure it's snug. Make sure it's all the way in the top or else\nthe rest of the phone won't snap down into place. So just run your fingers down the sides of\nthe phone, snap it all in, make sure it gets in at the bottom as well. Phone turns on, everything looks good, make\nsure you get those bottom two Pentalobe screws in place. And test out the charging port. Looks great. If you have any questions, make sure to leave\nthem in the comments, also read the comments, some people leave very good tips and suggestions\nas you're dong your project.

Lift up on your screen with a suction cup and then I use a razor blade to slide between the screen and the frame. There will be tools and parts listed down in the video description below. Take out the four screws that's holding down the metal plate, lift off the plate and then there's three ribbon cables here attached to the main board. Similar to Legos, just unsnap them. Once again tools and parts will be down in the video description below. Right now I'm disconnecting the headphone jack and the microphone from the frame of the phone. And I'll show you how to do that here in just a second. And then here you can see where the loudspeaker connects to the charging port cable. lining it up with the screws so you're ready to put it back on when the time comes. If there are any parts that are on your old charging port that aren't on your new one, you need to move them over. Most charging ports will not come with that so just disconnect it from your old one. actual charging port itself. And then just getting that screen back into place there's those three ribbon cable connectors right there as well. So like I said, pretty simple repair. And remember any tools or parts that you need are always going to be in the video description. little latch that you can snap down into place.

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S4 Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to a huge Effy's video and in this video I'm gonna be restoring this samsung galaxy s4 which I recently brought in a lot of Android smartphones which I will be later restoring in future videos and the first phone I'm taking a look at today from the light is this galaxy s4 it has a shattered display and a chipped and marked frame now I actually got two of these in the lot so I'm going to be working on those today I will only be restoring one of them but we'll get into why I needed both of them later in this video for now I'll need to restore this Samsung Galaxy s4 back to factory settings and that is done by holding the home button and volume up key while pairing on the device and will boot into Android recovery from there you can actually factory reset the device which will wipe all of the content and all the passwords off of it and you'll be able to set it up as a new device which is what I had to do as this was a phone that was sent to a recycling center but it still had somebody's dollar on so I went ahead and wiped that and now I can set it up as a factory device doing that I can make sure the device actually functions which it does and you can see here everything seems to be working other than the damage to the screen and frame of the phone now I can shut down the device and begin working on it to remove the battery it's very simple it just unclips from the phone once you remove that back door that's a really neat feature about the s4 s and S 5 s and a lot of the earlier Samsung phones there is a few today that you can buy that actually still have removable batteries but it's something Apple never did go out to Samsung for actually having that as a feature for many years you'll need to unclip the frame after removing the screws you can see there's a few components on there like the speaker which will actually remain on that mid frame next I can start to disconnect a lot of these cables that go to different parts and components in the phone the home button itself is connected on to the dock connector so that will need to be unplugged as well I can undo a heap of flex cables on the motherboard itself and there's one screw actually holding the motherboard into the frame and once that's removed it's actually just held in by the cables so it falls right out the first thing that I noticed when removing this board that a lot of people probably missed was that the power button and volume buttons are soldered directly to the motherboard of the phone so whether the battery can be replaced easily by the user isn't really important if the power button stops working and would require micro soldiering to be repaired now for this repair I do need to transfer everything inside of the frame into the new frame which also houses the replacement display moving along to the dock connector thankfully that is removable in a separate piece so if it needed to be replaced that's very easy to do which is something that can't be said about the Samsung Galaxy S 10 as that's one piece and is connected directly to the motherboard so it cannot be easily replaced with all of the components removed from the old display it's time to reinstall them into the new display now you may have noticed nothing appears to be screwed in now that's actually because the outer shell that screws down actually tightens and holds in place everything inside the phone so once you remove that everything sort of is just sitting inside the phone most of the components are quite easy to get to and aren't very hard to remove at all the only downside to this phone is its plastic build construction but I guess that makes it a nice way to be able to easily replace that battery with all the little parts and components installed I can reinstall the motherboard back into the phone and get everything connected up so I can test out the phone and make sure it's still working I'd like to say at this point in the repair everything was going fine and was very simple and easy to do I didn't run into any hiccups until I tried to connect the display it appears that the connection wasn't the same but at a closer inspection and appeared that the cable was just a slight bit higher so with some repositioning it connected and I could test out the phone you can see that it's functional the screen is working the touch screen is working and if appears to be fine so it was time to reinstall the back of a phone to complete the restoration of the device with the mid frame clipped in I could reinstall the screws holding in the frame itself and transfer across the label itself which contains the IMEI and serial number for the phone which is just a neat little thing that I'd like to keep attached to the phone I can reinstall the battery and back door now it's time to flip it over and test out the phone pressing and holding the power button I found that it was completely dead and didn't show any signs of life that's never a good sign so I cracked open the phone again by removing all of those screws and putting in a test battery again holding the power button and mysteriously the phone turned on again so whilst it was on I decided to clip in the back of the phone as that was obviously causing the issue clipping it in it seemed to be okay at first until I saw a flicker on the display they got me a little curious but I kept pressing and it's dead completely unresponsive on the display there seems to be something seriously wrong not to fear I connected up the original display because I thought maybe the connection on the motherboard itself was faulty testing it out with the spudger it doesn't seem to be affected by anything so I cracked out a second Galaxy s4 smartphone that I had laying around from that same part slot I thought I'd give it a go with that display given it has a slightly different model number now little did I know that there's two different editions of the Galaxy s4 which have entirely different CPUs and I'm guessing that is the issue with the display I'm not sure exactly why that is but we're going to test it out with this phone to see if this makes any difference so I'll need to go about the same process as I did the first time to completely tear down the device now as I've transferred across most of the components I'll only need to transfer across the motherboard at first to see if that makes any difference the phone on the right is the one with the new display that we just installed that is having the issue and the one on the left is a 9500 and 7 Series s which we're going to be trying out and seeing if that makes any difference to my eye I can't tell the difference between the two models of s4 to me they both look the same but obviously there is some internal differences with the CPUs and some of the chips used with the board now swapped over I can connect everything back up and install a battery pressing and holding the power button I get this weird screen where it just sort of detects the battery but it just won't turn on and that's never a good sign either I mean we're getting more than last time but it's still not working so out of curiosity I disconnected the dock connector and sure enough the phone powered on and functioned so it turns out the dock connectors between the two models of Samsung Galaxy s4 aren't compatible so if you're looking to repair one of these make sure you get the right parts for the right model number of s4 that you're working on because connecting up the dock connector that came from the original frame the phone panels on just fine and I can reassemble the phone back up although I still don't know if the frame will interfere with the display like it did with the previous s4 that I attempted to repair with the screws installed I can put the back on pressing and holding the power button it displays the Samsung Galaxy s4 logo and once the phone's booted up it works flawlessly like any s4 should so it goes to show that you need to get the right display and right components for the model of galaxy s4 the you own I didn't realize this at the time but luckily I had two of these so I ended up getting to fix one of them although I will be fixing the other one in a later video now though I can remove the plastic film and cover from the Samsung logo and we're done so this is it a fully restored a samsung galaxy s4 which cost me $10 to purchase and with a $65 display replacement and new battery this s4 looks and performs like new in terms of repairability Samsung displays always tend to be a little bit more than iPhones of the same age especially in the older generations so that's always a downfall the batteries in these older generation Samsung's are replaceable which is great but obviously the lack of replaceable buttons can result in very difficult repairs to be able to fix small issues like a broken power button this device is running Android 4.3 as well I should also mention that you may notice the display flickering on the video itself that's not happening in real life that is just my camera picking up the refresh rate of the display it has no issues with the display coming out like the other one given its different model number which appears to be for an Australian iPhone which this s4 is if you keen on seeing more Android videos they'll be coming out in the upcoming months with the purchase of lots of Android phones that actually got given an LG G 6 as well as well as an s5 AJ Pro another S port and an exterior X which will all be coming in later videos so make sure you stick around for those and on that note this has been a huge EFI's video if you liked what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the phone

      "title": "HTC One (M7) Screen Repair &amp; Disassemble",
      "transcript": "Fix easy calm bringing you another repair video today looks like we're going to be working on an HTC One in today's video we're going to show you the steps necessary to remove and replace the HTC One S display assembly before we get started with our disassemble let's review our suggested tools plastic triangle opening tools small Phillips screwdriver plastic opening tools a spudger fine tip curved tweezers precision knife set a heat gun or a blow dryer taking a look at our HTC One you're going to notice we have a hairline crack that runs the length of our display assembly let's first get started here with our heat gun or a blow dryer and apply approximately about one to two minutes of heat trying to soften up our adhesive that's securing our display assembly in place we can also take a SIM card removal tool or a paper clip and remove the SIM card tray out of the side of the phone you'll notice the seams on our HTC One are very tight we used our precision knife kit here with the squared n tip to begin our separation at the top of the display assembly once we get inside that groove and lift the display assembly slightly we can either use a plastic opening tool or in our case a spudger to keep that gap open to not allow the adhesive to come back in contact with itself as you work yourself around the entire perimeter of the display assembly and separated completely from the framework now because our original display assembly is cracked and we're no longer going to use it we can utilize a razor blade or in our case our precision knife kit to go ahead and cut the ribbon cables for the display assembly to get it out the way and make maneuvering the framework away from the base of the bone a little bit easier from this point we're going to need to take a look at our replacement part you're going to notice that our replacement part for fix easy comm has the entire framework as well as the display assembly as one whole piece going around your replacement part and noticing where the clips are located on the framework as well as the area on the top portion of the frame where there's hooks will kind of give you an indication on how you're going to enter into the HTC one causing the least amount of damage what we've done is taken our precision knife and then laid our replacement part over top of our HTC One and made marks on the original framework to indicate where the clips are going to come in contact with the body of the phone now with our marks around the perimeter of the phone indicating where our clips are located we can go ahead and begin our entry down near the dock port using again our precision knife what you'll notice is that we begin our entry initially with our precision knife because of the tight gaps of the HTC one once our gaps are initiated we then bring in a triangle opening tool to continue that gap and really push the clips away from its secured location you'll notice here in our first corner that we have a decent gap started before we continue on let's take into consideration that we are replacing the entire framework for the display assembly so if we cause damage to the framework that's not a problem but let's try to cause as little damage to the actual phone's body as we possibly can as you move on to the next clips in line you're going to use a combination of your precision knife a triangle opening tool as well as the traditional plastic opening tools to assist you in releasing those clips remember use a little bit of patience and a little bit of strength but those clips will eventually release once we finally did release the first two clips on one side of our HTC we went ahead and went to the other side and see if we can work on the second corner now applying the same method utilizing our precision knife first and following up with a plastic opening tool to fully release the clip moving on to our second clip now here's our line that we scored earlier attack it first with the precision knife and our plastic opening tool to pop the clip out again with about half of our clips released around the phone we've actually just taken a grip of it and we were able to pop open the rest of our clips just utilizing our hands from this point if your phone is not releasing go ahead and continue with the same method using the precision knife as well as the plastic opening tool until the display assembly does come separated from the body of the phone with the rear cover removed let's be certain to keep track of our volume rocker on the side and now we can expect the body to see if we caused any damage during the opening of our HTC one which you'll notice here that we have not upon inspection of our display assembly you will notice a little bit of damage we did scratch it up a little bit maybe pry it on it a little but bringing in the replacement part you're going to recognize that we're going to be replacing this whole portion so that's not a problem at this point you'll notice that our phone's internals are built up on the back of the display assembly we're going to have to remove all the internal components and Transplant them on to our replacement part let's first get started with our 10 Phillips screws let's be very careful with these and keep very good track of them all of our screws have a specific location with different sizes and different threads so when you're removing the screws let's be sure to keep track of exactly where they go or our reassemble let's get started on removing some of our ribbon cables let's not forget by looking at our replacement part we'll notice the ones that are used for our display assembly which we previously cut when we first opened up our unit so we can go ahead and remove those first if you love some of this tape you'll notice our ribbon cables here are slid into white housing locking sockets with a black flip tab you can flip that tab up in a 90 degree angle and it will release that ribbon wire for you our other connections are simple push plug connections that we can use our spudger to gently pry up on and it should release it easily let's come over here to the other side of the motherboard and peel up this tape you're going to notice two screws on either side of this connection securing it down let's go ahead and remove those screws and use our spudger to get in under the connection and lift it to disconnect we have another locking socket here for this ribbon cable again let's lift up the black tab 90 degrees slide the ribbon cable out and let's go and peel it back for removal keep track of this bracket here for the corner let's be certain of its location as well as how it came off so we know how to replace it during our reassemble peeling up our tape here is going to reveal two things one another locking socket where we can flip up now a white tab 90 degrees release this cable and this cable is going to be one of the severed ones from our original display assembly and you're going to see a second screw here on one of our connections that was secured with one of our screws we removed previously with that screw removed we can now bring in our spudger get under it and pry it up for removal we have a series here of coaxial connections four in total we can use our spudger to get under and gently pry those up for removal with all of our ribbon wires removed our wafer plugs disconnected and our coaxial plugs removed we can now lift up the top portion of our motherboard removing it from our HTC One let's use our spudger and get underneath that battery to pry it up from its housing in the center of the phone there's quite a bit of adhesive so a little bit of patience is necessary when we're peeling the battery out let's now bring our attention to the bottom of our HTC One you'll notice we have a small connection here that's located on our dock port this is the wire for our loudspeaker let's use the pointed side of our spudger to gently pry up on that connection to remove it and then the flat side of our spudger to go ahead and peel the loudspeaker out of our phone and since we've previously removed all of our screws for our dock port it should be free for removal as well we have a final Philips screw here that needs to be removed and a small locking socket here that we can release and remove the ribbon cable out of the side of our lower motherboard our spudger can get under this plastic protective cover and lift it from the motherboard we can peel up the connection here for our power button and sensors and we have a small clip here in the corner of the motherboard that we want to keep track of where our reassemble we're going to peel up the lower motherboard all in one piece before doing so let's make sure that we release it the adhesive securing the volume buttons on the side of the phone and with those volume buttons released we can use our spudger get under the motherboard and bring it up entirely with all of its components intact rear-facing camera our front-facing camera as well as our vibration motor all in one step we could now remove the earpiece speaker that is very snug in its housing in our last piece which is going to be our power buttons and sensors here at the top of the phone let's go ahead and remove those with all of our components removed from our original housing let's bring in now our replacement part and compare the two you'll notice they're virtually identical - the two ribbon cables that are for our new display assembly on the front of our replacement part we're going to transplant what we just took out of our original frame to our new frame work with our reassembling all of the parts and tools you've seen today in this video are available at WWF it's easy calm don't forget to subscribe to our

replace the display assembly on your M8 before we get started with our disassemble let's review our suggested tools small Philips screwdriver a spudger fine tipped curved tweezer a heat gun or a blow dryer T5 Torx screwdriver SIM card ejection tool Precision Knife Set taking a look here at our M8 before we start any part of the disassemble let's go ahead and power down the unit we're going to look to begin our entry by removing the top and bottom grills on either side of the display assembly we're going to begin first with our heat gun or blow dryer applying a small amount of heat to soften up the adhesive to make peeling up these grills a little easier you'll see we Ed the Precision knife kit to begin the separation of our grills the seams on the M8 are very tight so we prefer to use the thinnest Edge possible to begin our separation of these grills as to not Mar up the sides of our outside framework when peeling in these up we did try to cause as little damage as possible but do keep in mind you will receive another set of replacement grills along with your new display assembly we've got got a series of six screws that's going to be securing the display assembly down it's a combination of two small fillip screws and T5 Torx bit screws for the other four if you haven't done so already you can remove the SIM card tray as well as the micro SD card tray from the sides of the phone using a SIM card removal tool or a paper clip very similar to the grills on the front of our phone we have very type seams on our M8 we found it easiest and cause the least amount of damage using a Precision knife kit to pop free the clips you'll see we freed a few on each side of the phone before finally taking a firm grip of the display assembly and peeling away the back housing be sure to keep track of that power button for our reassembly later once into our internals you're going to recognize the majority of our connections is covered up with protective tape let's remove that tape by using a little bit of heat from our heat gun or blow dryer to soften it up making it easier to peel back and not cause damage to our ribbon cables let's now start getting after some of these connections let's first start with the two Co axle cable connections on this side of the motherboard by simply popping them free below them is the terminal for our battery that's secured with two small filp screws let's remove those screws and then pop free our connection we've also got two coxal cable connections on the other side of the motherboard that we want to release the rest of our connections are locking sockets that we want to flip up to release before sliding the ribbon cables out let's not forget our coxal cable connection here in the corner and then now we can go through and back out all of our ribbon cables from our locking sockets keep in mind this connection here has our volume buttons adhere to the side of the phone you'll see that we used a small amount of heat so that we could peel up that volume button before completely backing out the ribbon cable from its socket let's be careful as we Slide the rest of our ribbon cables safely out of their sockets we've got three T5 Torx bit screws securing this top board down let's go ahead and back those screws out and then it should release this top board for complete removal we've got this plastic cover that we need to remove that's just above the rear-facing camera and now let's release some of our connections starting here first with the front-facing camera a connection here for our display assembly one more here on the other side of the display assembly and then we also have a small plug here for the vibration motor be careful care ful with this one when you're backing it out as it as slightly delicate the vibration motor should pick right up out of its housing we can now Slide the ribbon cables out from either side for our display assembly you've got four small securing Phillips screws one on on either corner of this portion of our board let's back those out let's not forget to peel up our proximity sensor in the top of the phone you'll see here we used a little bit of heat to soften up the adhesive to make peeling it back a little easier we've got a final screw securing this portion of our board down hiding here under our rear facing camera let's back that screw out and our board should be free for complete removal let's continue on by removing our front-facing camera our earpiece speaker is sitting nicely in its housing we can peel it up now our loudspeaker is going to be next we'll again use a little bit of heat to soften it up and then we'll use our tweezers to gently peel it up from its location our dock Port assembly should peel up just as easily we'll use a plastic spudger here as to try to not cause damage to the bottom side of our assembly with the dock Port out of our way the battery in the center of the phone's going to be last it is held down with quite a bit of adhesive we recommend that you take your time use plenty of heat and a plastic spudger with a little bit of patience you'll finally be able to maneuver the battery away from the phone at this point we're going to bring in our replacement part so that we can compare it to our existing display assembly as you'll notice front to back they're identical to each other what we'll be doing is transplanting all the parts that we just removed from our existing display over to our replacement here's those extra grills that we mentioned earlier in the video for our reassembly let's now begin the reassembly of our M8 you'll notice that we're actually going to be using our existing display because when we first disassembled the phone it wasn't broken let's start first here with our battery and make sure that we align the terminal on the proper side of the phone you'll see we softened up our existing adhesive here with a little bit of heat before setting it in place our next piece into the bottom of the phone is going to be our dock Port assembly you can press it firmly into the securing adhesive and we even used a little bit of heat to soften it up first next we bring in our loudspeaker over top of the dock port and then we'll flip our phone over to bring our attention to the top portion of it we're going to bring in our replacement part so we can show you that it has adhesive pre-installed already we're using our our existing display so we're going to heat up the majority of our existing adhesive to get things to settle in nicely the first piece back into the top of our phone is going to be our loudspeaker followed by our front-facing camera into its housing we've got that bottom board that we're going to maneuver back into place but let's check that connections down on the bottom for our rear-facing camera to make sure it's secure let's maneuver the board around the connection for our front-facing camera and once in place we can secure the connection for our camera and then bolt down the securing screw that's right below the rear-facing camera we can now reinstall the four securing screws one on each corner of the board next we secure our proximity sensor into the top of the phone with the remaining adhesive with the sensor secure in its location we can now bring our attention to the ribbon wires on each side of the board sliding them into their lock in sockets and then flipping the lock down securing the connection we can now push the vibration motor back down into its housing and connect the small plug into the board time to maneuver the top board back down into its location with the mounting screws aligned we can bring in the three torque screws to secure it down into place once the board's locked down with its screws let's begin reinstalling all of our ribbon connections sliding the ribbon cables in locking the sockets and securing that connection continue that same pattern with all of our locking sockets all array around this top board when you get to a co- axle connection like the one here in the corner it's just simply putting it onto the socket and press pressing firmly down to secure its connection take your time make sure all of these connections are very secure as you want to make sure the phone fully functions upon power up bringing our attention to the other side of the board now again repeating the same pattern as we did on the other side slide in lock down fully secured here's our battery terminal connection that we can press firmly down to secure it onto the board and we can settle down our two Co axle cable connections here on this side as well our tiny ribbon connection for the dock port and the two Philip screws that secure the battery terminal down we are now going to position our protective tape over top of our secured connections let's make sure that our adhesive for our volume buttons on the side of the phone is holding it securely in place let's not forget our final two Co axle cable connections for the top board we can finally set in the plastic cover over top of the smaller board bringing in the rear cover for reinstallation along with the power button be patient with the power button and work slowly to try to keep it in its housing as you made it back down with the display assembly once you have the first of a couple of the clips secured then you can begin to work around the perimeter of the phone securing it down into place once the display is flush all the way around the perimeter of the phone we're in the home stretch let's bring in the six securing screws the two Phillips in the top portion of the phone and the four torque screws down in the bottom we're going to reinstall our existing grills so we're going to use a small amount of heat to soften up the adhesive for their reinstallation position them down and press firmly into place we can now reinstall the micro SD and SIM card trays and power the phone on to check for full functionality and there you have it another successful repair by fix easy.com all of the parts and tools you've seen today in this video are available at www.fixez.com don't forget to subscribe to our

      "transcript": "this is the HTC1 touchscreen digitizer replacement guide by repairs Universe the recommended tools for performing this repair are a metal pry tool Nyland spudger a small Philip screwdriver suction cup and adhesive strips before performing this or any other repair be sure the phone is fully shut off remove the SIM card and SIM card tray by inserting a SIM card removal tool or a paper clip and pop the SIM tray out of the phone now apply your suction cup towards the top of the screen pull on the screen until you have enough gap between the screen and the housing to insert your pry tool for leverage you will want to work your way from the top of the phone towards the bottom as the screen is still connected by two Flex cables on the motherboard with the screen now released from the inner housing The Next Step will be to remove the back cover from the midf frame in this example we are using a nylon spudger because the back metal cover is very strong considerable Force may be needed to initially release the clips holding them together if you were finding that using a plastic or nylon pry tool is not strong enough try using a metal pry tool for extra leverage take your pry tool and insert it between the mid-frame and back cover we found a good entry point towards top right of the frame just above the volume buttons once you have enough of your pry tool inserted work your way around all sides of the housing to release the clips holding the two pieces together until you can remove the back cover entirely next you need to take your small Philips screwdriver and remove 13 screws if you look to the right of your screen you will see we have these screw locations circled in red for your reference note that all of these screws are the same size so you won't need to worry about mixing them up place them in a neat pile off to the side for reassembly you will notice that some of the screws and flex cable connections are covered with tape that you will need to gently peel away to expose them in most cases this tape can be peeled back and reused during reassembly in other cases you may need to cut the tape in order to expose screws or connection you will notice here there are two screws holding down this pop connector with the screws removed you will be able to gently release the connection using your pry tool or fingernail next release the long black antenna cable running along the right side of the motherboard use your pry tool to generally release the antenna connections there are a few pieces of black tape that you will need to peel away to release the cable on the right side we have Jawbone connection that will need to be unlatched simply lift up on the black tab using your pry tool in order to release the flex cable from the connector unlatch the second Jawbone connection then release both Flex cables next you will need to disconnect two antenna cables located at the top left of the sister board you can optionally disconnect them from the motherboard as well for your convenience then take your pry tool and lift out the black space are located above the rear camera to the right of the motherboard you will see another small antenna cable you will need to disconnect next you will have a series of flex cables you will need to release from the motherboard to the right of your screen you will see a diagram of these connections highlighted for your convenience keep in mind that you will have to remove some tape to expose the connections and additional screws when peeling up the tape covering the battery connection you will see a second screen screw you will need to remove to disconnect the battery making your way back up to the top right of the device you will need to release the pop connector on the end of the ribbon cable that Bridges the sister board to the motherboard note you may need to peel up additional tape that adheres this Bridge cable to the long black Flex cable for your screen assembly when you lift out the bridge connection you will expose the 13th small Phillips screw you will need to remove double check that you have removed all 13 screws before removing the motherboard next using your pride tool gently lift the motherboard from the top just beneath the rear camera be careful not to bend the motherboard when releasing the adhesive that is securing it to the surface of the battery slowly work your way from top to bottom being careful not to damage any components on the motherboard with the motherboard removed you can now remove the battery from the right hand side insert your pry tool between the battery and the housing be aware that there is a substantial amount of adhesive securing the battery to the mid-frame when prying the battery out you will need to take extreme care not to bend the battery too much as you could possibly damage it you will want to apply pressure to the middle of the battery as much as possible to prevent this if you are replacing the screen assembly only you do not need to remove the sister board replacing other components on the phone may require that the sister board be removed before you can remove the sister board you will need to pop out the vibrate motor from its housing and release one final Jawbone connection shown in the figure to your right if you notice the silver bracket comes loose from the top of the sister board set it off to the side for reassembly you will now need to peel up the volume button Flex cable from the side of the housing gently use your pry tool to peel and lift up the ribbon cable and release the adhesive using your pry tool gently pry up from underneath the sister board and free it from the housing you may also need to help release the front camera from the housing so you don't rip the cable when removing the sister Port you can now replace any necessary components on the sister board or underneath it before removing the screen assembly remember to peel off all of the adhesive tape and Bridge connectors so you can easily Slide the flex cables through the slots and in the housing before installing your new screen replacement check to make sure you can reuse the factory adhesive to ensure a flush fit you can always apply fresh adhesive strips to the inner housing if you find the factory adhesive may not be tacky enough to secure your new screen Slide the flex cables through the slots in the housing and press your new screen firmly on all sides checking to make sure it lines up properly inside the housing if you remove the sister board perform the following steps to reinstall it before placing the sister board back in the housing make sure to line up the vibrate motor audio jack and front camera to their individual slots on the housing reconnect your power button Flex cable to the jobon connector and make sure the power button is secured properly in the slot on the housing reapply your volume button Flex cable to the side of the housing and double check that the sister board is seated proper relate to the housing reinstall your battery making sure it adheres firmly to the housing next rein install your motherboard and line it up properly with the screw locations on the housing you can now begin to connect all of the flex cable and antenna connections on the motherboard to the right of your screen you will see a diagram of the flex cables and antenna connections for your reference make sure that when reconnecting the jawone connections you press the white tabs down to secure the connection always check to make sure there are no flex cables or antenna wires under any of the components you have just installed as we see here one of the antenna cables was under the vibrate motor and we are removing it we can now continue with the installation of the motherboard now reinstall the black spacer at the top of the phone above the camera after you have checked your connections you can now begin to install the 13 small Phillips screws in the location circled in red to the right of your screen run the screws down until you feel a light resistance that's all that's required to secure the motherboard and other components now check your connections again and verify that the boards and components are seated in their proper locations reinstall the volume button in the back cover if it fits Loosely in its location a small piece of Scotch tape on the outside will temporarily hold it in position for reassembly make sure the power button and headphone jack are in their proper locations beginning at the top of the phone

up the adhesive to make peeling up these grilles a little easier you'll see we used a precision knife kit to begin the separation of our grilles the seams on the m8 are very tight so we prefer to use the thinnest edge possible to begin our separation of these grilles as to not Mar up the sides of our outside framework when peeling these up we did try to cause as little damage as possible but do keep in mind you will receive another set of replacement grilles along with your new display assembly you we've got a series of six screws that's going to be securing the display assembly down it's a combination of two small Phillips screws and t5 Torx bit screws for the other four you if you haven't done so already you can remove the SIM card tray as well as the micro SD card tray from the sides of the phone using a SIM card removal tool or a paper clip very similar to the grills on the front of our phone we have very type seams on our m8 we found it easiest and caused the least amount of damage using a precision knife kit to pop free the clips you you'll see we freed a few on each side of the phone before finally taking a firm grip of the display assembly and peeling away the back housing you be sure to keep track of that power button for our reassembly later once into our internals you're going to recognize the majority of our connections is covered up for protective tape let's remove that tape by using a little bit of heat from our heat gun or blow-dryer to soften it up making it easier to peel back and not cause damage to our ribbon cables you let's now start getting after some of these connections let's first start with the two coaxial cable connections on this side of the motherboard by simply popping them free below them is the terminal for our battery that's secured with two small Phillips screws let's remove those screws and then pop free our connection you we've also got to coax okay connections on the other side of the motherboard that we want to release the rest of our connections are locking sockets that we want to flip up to release before sliding the ribbon cables out let's not forget our coaxial cable connection here in the corner and then now we can go through and back out all of our ribbon cables from our locking sockets keep in mind this connection here has our volume buttons adhered to the side of the phone you'll see that we use the small amount of heat so that we could peel up that volume button before completely backing out the ribbon cable from its socket you let's be careful as we slide the rest of our ribbon cables safely out of their sockets you we've got three t5 Torx bits screws securing this top board down let's go ahead and back those screws out and then it should release this top board for complete removal you we've got this plastic cover that we to remove that's just above the rear-facing camera and now let's release some of our connections starting here first with the front-facing camera a connection here for our display assembly one more here on the other side of the display assembly and then we also have a small plug here for the vibration motor be careful with this one when you're backing it out as it has slightly delicate the vibration motor should pick right up out of its housing we can now slide the ribbon cables out from either side for our display assembly you've got four small securing Phillips screws one on either corner of this portion of our board let's back those out let's not forget to peel up our proximity sensor in the top of the phone you'll see here we use a little bit of heat to soften up the adhesive to make peeling it back a little easier we've got a final screw securing this portion of our board down hiding here under our rear facing camera let's back that screw out and our board should be free for complete removal let's continue on by removing our front-facing camera our earpiece speaker is sitting nicely in its housing we can peel it up now our loudspeakers gonna be next will again use a little bit of heat to soften it up and then we'll use our tweezers to gently peel it up from its location our dock port assembly should peel up just as easily we'll use a plastic spudger here as to try to not cause damage to the bottom side of our assembly with the dock port out of our way the battery in the center of the phones going to be last it is held down with quite a bit of adhesive we recommend that you take your time use plenty of heat and a plastic spudger you with a little bit of patience you'll finally be able to maneuver the battery away from the phone at this point we're going to bring in our replacement part so that we can compare it to our existing display assembly as you'll notice front to back they're identical to each other what we'll be doing is transplanting all the parts that we just removed from our existing display over to our replacement here's those extra grilles that we mentioned earlier in the video for our reassembly let's now begin the reassembly of our m8 you'll notice that we're actually going to be using our existing display because when we first disassembled the phone it wasn't broken let's start first here with our battery and make sure that we align the terminal on the proper side of the phone you'll see we softened up our existing adhesive here with a little bit of heat before setting it in place you our next piece into the bottom of the phone is gonna be our dock board assembly you can press it firmly into the securing adhesive and we even used a little bit of heat to soften it up first next we bring in our loudspeaker over top of the dock port and then we'll flip our phone over to bring our attention to the top portion of it we're gonna bring in our replacement part so we can show you that it has adhesive pre-installed already we're using our existing display so we're gonna heat up the majority of our existing adhesive to get things to settle in nicely the first piece back into the top of our phone is going to be our loudspeaker followed by our front-facing camera into its housing we've got that bottom board that we're going to maneuver back into place but let's check that connections down on the bottom for our rear facing camera to make sure it's secure let's maneuver the board around the connection for our front-facing camera and once in place we can secure the connection for our camera and then bolt down the securing screw that's right below the rear-facing camera we can now reinstall the four securing screws one on each corner of the board you next we secure our proximity sensor into the top of the phone with the remaining adhesive with the sensor secured its location we can now bring our attention to the ribbon wires on each side of the board sliding them into their locking sockets and then flipping the lock down securing the connection we can now push the vibration motor back down into its housing and connect the small plug into the board time to maneuver the top board back down into its location with the mounting screws aligned we can bring in the three Torx screws to secure it down into place you once the board's locked down with its screws let's begin reinstalling all of our ribbon connections sliding the ribbon cables in locking the sockets and securing that connection continue that same pattern with all of our locking sockets all the way around this top board when you get to a coaxial connection like the one here in the corner it's just simply putting it onto the socket and pressing firmly down to secure its connection take your time make sure all of these connections are very secure as you want to make sure the phone fully functions upon power up bringing our attention to the other side of the board now again repeating the same pattern as we did on the other side slide in lockdown fully secured you here's our battery terminal connection that we can press firmly down to secure it onto the board and we can settle down our two coaxial cable connections here on this side as well you our tiny ribbon connection for the dock port and the two Phillips screws that secure the battery terminal down we are now going to position our protective tape over top of our secured connections let's make sure that our adhesive for our volume buttons on the side of the phone is holding it securely in place let's not forget our final two coaxial cable connections for the top board we can finally set in the plastic cover over top of the smaller board bringing in the rear cover for reinstallation along with the power button be patient with the power button and works slowly to try to keep it in its housing as you made it back down with the display assembly once you have the first of a couple of the clips secured then you can begin to work around the perimeter of the phone securing it down into place once the display is flush all the way around the perimeter of the phone we're in the homestretch let's bring in the six securing screws the two Phillips in the top portion of the phone and the four Torx screws down on the bottom you we're going to reinstall our existing grills so we're gonna use a small amount of heat to soften up the adhesive for their reinstallation position them down and press firmly into place you we can now reinstall the microSD and SIM card trays and power the phone on to check for full functionality and there you have it another successful repair by repairs universe calm all of the replacement parts and tools that you've seen in this video today are available at

      "title": "Blackberry Z10 Take Apart - Tear down - Screen Repair",
      "transcript": "because what we have here is the blackberry z10 what we need today as a take apart oh yeah I've got a broken screen on it smashed it pretty good don't see it there so we're gonna replace that actually I'm just gonna show you how to take it apart and then you would basically reassemble at all the exact same way so let's get started take off the battery door tools you need either a plastic pry tool I just use a soil smudger and then I also have a t1 and a t3 just start with the t-34 the screws in the back you know one two three four five six seven eight nine screws you have to remove to take this back plate off here this faucet back like and note that the one screw is break here it has a warranty sticker over it and you ought to remove that or just push through it to get that screw so we'll take this out right now certain lighting yeah our screws out all the Boxster's they're all the same size it doesn't matter where you put them and when you put it back together just make sure that you do have your memory card taken out if you did have one in there because it will fry up against the plastic idol rip here your SIM card tray off before if you don't memory card if it's an artist or the SIM card if it's in there you can actually leave the SIM card Ian doesn't make a difference so where I like to start you can either start here with something small and thin to pry up this plastic black plastic plate on the back or you can start down here that's what I actually prefer you do it this way so much easier just watch you don't hitting the board components when you're doing this and we'll all pop up nicely back up there now and then I find that once you get this back corner up hard from the inside the Rose Brown before it'll come up nice and then you work your way from the bottom to the top price um or there is some some double-sided kind of tape foamy tape stuff on the battery connector so if you reach in the side it will just pull off or if you reach inside you can actually just use your pry tool and pry it off the top of it it makes a little easier just so you don't you're not pulling on the board too much just it'll be right on here you can see there it is on the backside there that white spot once that's unglued it comes off nice and easy and then you have the internals there so then you want to get all your flex cables off pretty much any flex cable you see plugged in does have to come unplugged so you have the top one here for your vibrator you have your headphone jack up here then you have your LCD and digitizer here okay so all those are unplugged and basically it's it's much like the iPhone I was really surprised when I took it apart they same basic shape and everything and how it comes out for the most part it is kind of push down into the side so it's a little bit tricky to get out it'll feel like it's binding on something but once it done comes unclipped very simple and then so to get the LCD off there's a couple more screws you have to take off there's a seam here it's good to see the screw here stay right there silver screw there's a blue screw right here there's a gold screw up in the top right corner up here and then there's gonna be four long black screws that are in the frame one here here here and here so you take all those o next those would be all t1 screws very small you do have to go in the same places the four on the outside of the frame are all the same but the the silver the blue and the gold do you have to go in the same place and the gold even with bad lighting this isn't a difficult thing to do so much easier than I anticipated would it be okay so next you basically have to remove this this copper sticker so that you can pull your ear ribbon cables up because they do have to be fed through the metal chassis for the for the LCD frame just basically peels off like so that and these just peel upwards they are glued to the frame so just be careful when you're peeling them up you don't rip them rip when you up that imagine they're fragile just like they are and you have it and that's where they slide through though to the frame just right here they do come out kind of weird because they are so big as you can see and there's so many of them so you got to be super careful when you when you push them with the frame so there's a basically the easiest way I find to do this is there's if you look closely enough you can build a seat here but there's a little hole right here you can see where it's shiny that's actually the back side of the LCD you can push there to press the LCD out and you can push up here I recommend you start at the top actually if you look right underneath the look under the vibrator you can see it there shinier there as well that is the back of the LCD as well and I find it works well if you start pushing the top corner up here the LCD is latched in the bottom has to go from the top to the bottom so this is the best place to start I'll show you why when you graph it ground grab it just hold the top of the frame and then push through and you'll see the LC you'll start to split so so put your finger in there and then basically just work your way around the top see no screws you took oh do you have to come out because they are into the LCD frame so we don't take those out you're just gonna be making a whole mess comes down like that and pull it to would be the left and you have your new screen connectors here see in the wall they're really kind of lined up there so you really gotta get creative with the we take it out here turn and bend them and then give it a turn this will suit your LCDs like this and there you have your LCD I guess it not nearly as bad as I thought I was gonna be a new chassis it also actually looks fairly simple with the iPhone you have your ear speaker nice and easy to fix your loudspeaker is going to be in here in the black path I'm the black past black plastic back piece at the bottom so I'm not sure if that's gonna come out as one piece or how difficult that's gonna be I imagine it's all gonna be made as one piece here not sure but that's what it looks like and therefore the headphone jack it looks like it's all built in here now vibrator I believe just is glued on there can you have the Flex port for the microphone the microphone is just in the bottom here as you can see that little round piece the flex cable yeah there it is it's got two connectors on it it's just gonna be glued on there from what I can tell looks like it'll be super easy to replace and there you have it that's the z10 take apart thanks for watching you",

of our phone's case after removing the rear portion of the case we can now bring our attention to the battery let's use our Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws that secures the battery turn terminal and now that the terminal is removed we can use our spudger to pry the battery up and out of the phone there's an internal plastic cover that's protecting our motherboard we want to use our Phillips screwdriver and remove the the nine screws that are securing this cover once removed let's use our spudger to pry it up and out of the Pham the speaker assembly is next secured with two Phillips screws with those removed it should be able to lift out of the phone quite easily let's now work towards removing the motherboard from the phone we have a series of connections we want to address first with the flat side of our spudger we can start with our Co axle connection for our antenna the next connection is going to be our dock Port assembly connector let's lift the connection for the headphone jack assembly we have two plugs located here for our display assembly that we can pry up and our last connection which is for the rear-facing camera with that connection removed we can lift the camera out of the phone let's not forget to use a SIM card removal tool or a paperclip to remove the SIM card tray out of the side of the device and with the tray removed D the motherboard should be free for removal at this point you should be left with just a display assembly supported by its frame and a dock Port connector at the bottom we can leave those components on the frame as we don't have to remove everything to get the display assembly out safely to begin removal of the display assembly let's begin with our heat gun or blow dryer and begin to heat up the adhesive that is securing it to its frame about 1 to 2 minutes of heat should suffice and then we can begin the separation of the display assembly with our plastic opening tool where we enter from the grill area of your earpiece speaker gently pry up and work around the entire perimeter of the display assembly until it comes completely separated from your frame depending on how severe the damage was to your display assembly you might have some debris or shards of glass that's left behind in the adhesive as you remove your display assembly go ahead and use your spudger to clean up this area so

fish the ribbon cables through for our display with those cables through our framework we can now align everything up and begin to gently push down and secure our display assembly to our framework

      "transcript": "To disassemble and reassemble your Google Nexus 4 you will need.. a T5 Torx small Philips and bladed screwdriver you will also need a plastic separation tool you can use a guitar pick  a plastic knife or your thumbnail make sure the phone is switched off and then remove the sim tray and using your T5 Torx screwdriver undo these 2 screws now coming round to the side where the sim tray is use a thin plastic tool and insert it into this corner here  once you have got it in release the clips which I have marked in white around the outside edge take your time and keep releasing those clips as you go round be careful where the the sim tray is because its very weak there do not lift the rear cover away yet just lift it away a small amount and there is 2 more clips to release there is one just about the volume key and on the other side just above the power switch now we can lift the rear case away do not worry if the keys fall out we can put them back later the rear cover contains a few antennas this one is for 4G NFC + Wireless Charging this one is for your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth GPS and another 4G Antenna If you need to remove the battery then we need to undo these 2 screws there is only 2 of these screws which have a very large flat head so you cannot get them mixed up using a plastic tool so we do not short the battery lift that ribbon connector off The battery is extremely well secured with double sided tape   it will take lots of leverage and some heat to remove it start by lifting this tape off and disconnect the 3G/GSM antenna cable and gently move this out of the way so it does not get trapped now using a thin plastic blade to prevent damage to the battery lever between the the metal case and the plastic blade  trying to lift the battery away this is coming off much easier because I have done it before but if you use some heat from a fan heater or hair drier it will help you remove the battery now we need to undo 9 screws around the outside of this cover these are all the same size so you do not \n have to worry about getting them mixed up you can skip this stage or any other by clicking \n on 'Next' at the top of this video now gently release 2 clips on this side that hold this cover in place there is a single clip here now gently lift the cover away and this contains the earpiece and the vibrating motor to replace the ear speaker lift the ribbon flex away, its double sided tape and gently lever the ear speaker away if your new one does not come with this rubber cover then you can transfer the cover over to your new speaker when you put it back together make sure you line the flex up with this little tag then place that back in again and gently push down on the flex to remove the vibrating motor gently lever from this side again double sided tape then put your new one back in again to replace the micro USB socket you will need to remove the loudspeaker housing after removing 2 silver screws lever from here and lift away this also contains the 3G and GSM antenna and if your new loudspeaker does not come with this rubber microphone gasket you can lift it away and put it into your new one now we need to disconnect this antenna cable using a small blade gently twist and lift the cable away from the board lift that away and put that aside now carefully unplug the usb flex and if you want to reuse this gently rock it side to side just some double sided tape holding that in if your are replacing it then do not worry about any damage just gently move it around and that will come away this USB flex contains the notification LED the main microphone is here and the sound enters from this side and your mico usb port if you need to replace your headphone jack then start by disconnecting the flex cable and insert a screwdriver and gently move side to side to separate the double sided tape now be careful  there is a very small rubber gasket which is easily lost so be careful not to lose that so this is the ambient light sensor and your proximity sensor when you replace the rubber gasket make sure the small tag points towards the centre of the headphone jack to remove the camera disconnect this flex cable this is for the main display and push that back and gently disconnect the camera and lift that away if you need to remove the mainboard then disconnect this flex cable here this is for the digitizer and push that back using a small screwdriver push the sim tray release catch through and the mainboard will lift away nice and easy this is your forward facing camera you can remove and replace this gently lift that away from the mainboard and then you can plug your replacement back in again this is your secondary microphone this sim tray is replaceable using a soldering iron there is a solder point in each corner and there is 7 in the centre this would normally be done using a hot air soldering iron these are the connections for your NFC and wireless charging and if you are recovering from water damage there might be water trapped underneath the LED flash lens it might be possible to remove this by unclipping these little clips around the side this device also has a small hole so make sure there is no water trapped in there to remove the volume keys gently twist and lever them away from the case same with the power switch gently twist and lift that out and if you have trouble you can use some tweezers if you have a new screen that does not come with this metal frame you will need to use heat to help separate the frame from the screen you can follow this link for a video on how to do this for reassembly start by taking the volume switches and make sure the 3 gold contacts have the open end going towards the front so this way round and place that into the chassis take the power switch and again make sure the open ends of the contacts go towards the front now take the mainboard and gently offer it into place making sure that it sits down nicely now move those flex cables out the way and replace the camera so place that in and line up that flex connector just keep moving it around until you feel it snap down into place now we can reconnect the display so gently push down until you feel it snap down and this is the digitizer now we can replace the headphone jack so make sure that small rubber gasket is on your proximity sensor and.. just try and slide that underneath the mainboard and make sure that is pushed all the way down if the proximity sensor is not pushed all the way home it can cause problems and reconnect the flex cable moving down to the bottom we can now replace the usb flex so offer it into the case and make sure that usb port is pushed all the way in and the board is sitting nice and flat if it is a new usb flex then it will not have this bend in the cable so using a blunt instrument you will need to push and put a bend in the cable and then plug it in now we can connect the 3G and GSM antenna flex plug this end in first and gently bring it down into place making sure that locates in the case and these little clips once you are satisfied that is sitting down nicely you can replace the loudspeaker antenna assembly push the bottom in first and that should snap down in place now we can replace the plastic cover pushing the clips in and there is.. another clip over this side now we can replace those 9 screws now replace the 2 silver screws in the speaker housing now move the antenna flex out the way and replace the battery make sure you put it right over to the outside edge of the phone to leave a space for the antenna flex on this side give that a good push to stick it down now reconnect the antenna flex and make sure that cable is pushed down now replace the tape and now we can reconnect the battery so bring the plug down line it up with the screw holes and push it down and replace those 2 large headed screws a final check to make sure.. everything is sitting down nicely and once you are satisfied that is ok we can replace the rear cover if you are replacing the rear cover you may have to exchange the volume and \n power keys over to your new case now the keys should have a little tag which holds them in place but it was missing on this one you can use some tape to hold it in place while you put the cover back on again if it does have a tag then it will look like this and you can remove that and put that into your new case when you put it back in make sure the little tag is sitting underneath those plastic pins now we can replace the cover so offer the volume key up to the phone first and bring that down and gently squeeze it into place make sure the top is pushed down once you are satisfied that is done you can replace your sim card and switch the phone on and while we are waiting for that to boot up we can replace those 2 T5 screws and we now have a fully restored Google Nexus 4 Thank you for watching Please Subscribe and give me the thumbs UP And I will be sure to

      "title": "Nexus 4 e960 Charging Port fix and Glass Screen Repair. To the point.",
      "transcript": "Alright so here we have the Nexus 4 e960 screen\nreplacement. This is a T-mobile phone. You can see that the screen is cracked right\nthere. First step is we’re going to take out the\nSIM card. Just take a little paper clip, pop it in the\nlittle circle hole and out pops the SIM card. The screen itself is unresponsive so I can’t\nturn the phone off, but it’s not a huge problem. There’s a pentalobe screw, two of them,\ndown at the very bottom so we’re going to unscrew those. Pop out the screws and then try to separate\nthe back housing from the screen right next to the silver part. You can see I’m taking my pry tool and kind\nof moving around. And all the parts for this project can be\nfound on Amazon: the screens, the charging port…everything. So I’ll list those in the video description\nbelow. This part is actually pretty complicated. The back housing is stuck very securely with\nthe screen. So it takes a second or two, more like 10\nminutes, to separate them. You kind of have to get aggressive there towards\nthe end. I found that starting by the charging port\nand prying up a little bit, and then using my fingers to hold it apart while I move down\nthe edge of the phone works the best. You can see it wanting to separate right there. And it clicks off. Luckily there are no wires or anything that\nconnect the back housing directly to the front, so you’ll be just fine pulling it apart. There are 11 different screws around the back. Make sure you keep them organized. Most of them are the same size except for\nthe bottom 2 and the 2 on the battery which I’m going to show you right now. Be very very careful when you’re lifting\nthis up; the part that’s connected to the motherboard is not very strong at all. So make sure you lift it directly off and\ndon’t pry it left or right very much or it will snap off. Remove this wire cable by lifting up very\ngently with your pry tool. And then remove the blue tape off the battery\nand you’ll be able to lift this wire up and out of your way. There are no screws holding down the motherboard\nwhich is nice, just these little ribbon cable connectors. They pop up and off the motherboard like Legos. They are pretty durable little guys so you\ncan just wiggle them straight up and out. This is for the screen. One of them is for the LCD and the other one\nis for the digitizer. Just lift them up and out of the way and then\nthe audio port has its own little ribbon cable right there as well. There are four of them total. Then the motherboard just kind of wiggles\nup and out from the housing. You can just set this off to the side. Now we’re going to take out the battery. The battery is very securely glued to the\nhousing and so you just kind of have to take your pry tool and wiggle it under. The flatter the pry tool the better. I like this little red stick so I use it quite\na lot. Anyway, you can be a little bit aggressive\nwith it. There’s nothing you can really damage underneath\nthere. Alright to get to the charging port, it’s\nunderneath this black piece. The charging port is just glued to the phone\nitself, so you just take the glue part that was at the bottom there; just kind of wiggle\nit gently up and then you can place the new charging port in its spot. It’s pretty simple. There’s nothing else really holding it down\nin place. And now we are heating up the screen so we\ncan separate the phone from the screen itself. I took about 45 seconds to heat it up. It’s got to be a little bit hotter…like\nif you touch it it’s got to be too hot to leave your finger there. That’s about the temperature that you want\nit at. I used a little razor to separate the screen\nfrom the housing. You can use whatever tool you want to. Just having a really thin tool helped me separate\nit. Be very careful when you’re prying up on\nthe glass; little shards will pop up. I recommend wearing safety glasses. Also if you can find a tool better than a\nrazor blade, you know, more power to you. Razor blades are not that safe. Once I got the screen pried up a little bit,\nI was able to take my red pry tool and kind of use it instead. Worked out a lot better. So very gently kind of pulling away. If the screen’s broken you don’t have\nto worry too much about damaging it anymore. The only thing I would recommend is try to\nget it off in one piece because the more big pieces you can get off the better. And just remember the screens that I buy,\nI get them from Amazon. So I will list those in the video description\nbelow if you just want to check out that link, I’ll have the right one all set up for ya. Same with the charging port. Sometimes you can get camera replacement lenses\nout on Amazon as well. Anyway so you can see right here as I was\nlifting it up, I didn’t quite grab the bottom part of the phone. The bottom part of the glass was still stuck\non there. So I tossed that and got the heat gun back\nout and heated it up for about another 45 seconds till it was almost too hot to touch. Then I used my super dangerous razor blade\nas well as my red plastic pry tool to kind of separate the glass from the rest of the\nphone. And you want to get every single little bit\nof glass that you can because when you put the new screen down on, if there’s even\njust one tiny little speck of glass it will make it so it’s not able to sit flush with\nthe phone. And it might even leave little pressure marks\non your LCD. So make sure you clean it off super well. You can even get the excess glue out from\naround the edges. It’s better to take your time so you only\nhave to do it once. The more times you take apart your phone the\nmore you’re at risk of damaging something. Anyway, so now we have the new screen. So we’re going to feed the ribbon cables\nthrough the phone. This is for the digitizer and LCD again. And once they’re feed through the phone\nyou got to make sure that everything is through so that some of the ribbon cables are not\nbunched up on the wrong side of the screen. You can see me pulling off a little plastic\nprotector right there. I’m making sure that all of the cables are\nfed through. Once I’m sure that the phone screen will\nsit flush with the phone and the ribbon cables are pulled through, I will grab my super glue,\nyou can also use double sided sticky tape if you want. I just find that super glue works just as\nwell and it keeps the phone sitting…the lens sitting a little more flush with the\nphone. The sticky tape just leaves a little bit of\nspace. So you can see me putting glue everywhere\nexcept for where the cameras are. And make sure that none of it will bleed over\nonto the cameras because once you’ve got it on a camera, there’s no coming off of\nthat. Set one end flush with the phone and I leave\nthe charging port end up a little bit so I can still put some glue around the edges as\nwell as get some glue down around the base. Luckily around the base there’s a lot of\nroom for the super glue. So I just kind of piled it up down there on\nthe bottom and I held it shut for probably about a minute or two to let the glue just\ndry a little bit and hold it still. Now that it’s dry, there’s a little plastic\npiece that works with the upper mic that kind of cups the sound in towards the motherboard. So make sure that little plastic piece is\nthere, that little gray thing at the top. And now I’m putting the black speaker in\nand over the charging port that you just replaced. The charging port is the whole blue motherboard\nunderneath that black speaker. I’ll list it in the video description. As you are putting the motherboard onto the\nphone, make sure you have all the little ribbon connectors pulled up and away so they aren’t\nunderneath the motherboard. Remember there are four of them as well as\nthe one wire cable. Make sure the camera is sitting flush inside\nthat little square. Then you can kind of see me pushing down on\nthe ribbon cables, getting them into place. It’s a lot like a Lego piece. They just kind of snap on. You can kind of hear them click when you press\nthem in. And you see the little wire cable there, then\npress in that and it will click in as well. You definitely know when they are connected\nagain. Now here’s the battery connector. Remember be very gentle with it. Clip it into place and then put the two screws\nback in. I turned on the phone really quick just to\nmake sure it was working before I put the rest of it together. Now put on the plastic motherboard protector\nand then get all of those screws that you had before…all of the black ones now that\naren’t for the battery should be the same size. And then the two silver screws go in the bottom,\nright above the charging port. Now the back housing is on. Putting the two screws back in for the bottom,\nthe pentalobe screws. And everything works. Anyway, thanks for watching. If you could subscribe that does mean a lot\nto me. I do like making these videos. And remember everything can be found in the\nvideo description below as far as parts and stuff go. Anyway, “like” if this video helped you,\nand don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching!",

      "title": "iPhone 5 Screen Repair done In 3 Minutes",
      "transcript": "Today we are going to take apart an iPhone I am going to show you how to take off and replace the screen in 3 minutes to start off, you grab your little star screwdriver, and there are two screws right next to the charging port. So unscrew each of those.  It is the same size of screw driver that you would use with your iPhone 4 or 4s. Once those are out, Grab a little suction cup. The bigger the suction cup the better. And then just pry up on the bottom of the screen.  In hindsight I probably should have used a plastic tool... So keep that in mind. There are ribbon cables up along the top. So be very careful when you are pulling it away. Because if you damage those ribbon cables (Especially on your new screen) You are going to have some problems. There are three little screws that you have to take out right here to unplug the ribbon cables from the phone and I'll show you those. This little metal plate comes right off as soon as you get the three little screws undone. Doing the iPhone 5 screen is MUCH easier than doing the iPhone 4 or 4s screen. to replace those screens you have to undo about 30 screws The little bracket just slid right off... As far as the flex cables go, you can just pop them off with your pry tool They are just like little snaps. Similar to Legos. So there are 2 on top, and 1 underneath. And that releases the screen! Now get rid of your old screen, and put your new screen on. Grab each little flex cable, just like you would a Lego, and press them down and snap them in place. Once I got them all placed down, I used my finger to give them one little more push to make sure they\nare all connected. Keep in mind that the screws are also\ndifferent sizes the two bottom screw the same size but\nthe top screw is a little bit longer. (I am going to speed this up just a bit because the screws were hard to get into place.) There you go! When you put the screen back down, make sure to slide the top in first. Then you can slide your hands down the slide and clip the rest of the screen into place. After you are done and the screen is in place, you can put the bottom two star screws in; Pentalobe screws. (Check the video description for parts and tools.) And there you go! If you have any questions be sure to leave them in the comments.

      "title": "iPhone 5s battery replacement in 6 minutes!",
      "transcript": "All right, today we're going to take out the\nbattery in the iPhone 5s. First take your Pentalobe screwdriver, the\nsame screwdriver that's used for all of the iPhones, and take out the two screws near\nthe base. Then take your suction cup and put it as close\nto the home button as possible. And take a metal pry tool or anything that's\nsturdy enough to fit between the glass screen and the metal frame. I like to use a razor blade just because of\nhow firm it is. It doesn't bend around and it makes sure that\nthe screen comes up when in control. So you can see I'm just barely prying it up\nvery very gently right here, and then I'm going to switch to a plastic tool to not damage\nthe frame or the screen. And you have to very careful when you're lifting\nit up because there is a little ribbon cable attached to the home button that you can see\nright here, and there is a little clasp that you have to lift up. It's just like a little latch so I'm going\nto get my little pry tool in there and just clip it up. You can see it bend back just like a little\ndoor. And the whole little thing comes off, you\ncan see that it'll detach itself as soon as I get the ribbon cable un-clipped. It's just kind of like a LEGO. So I lift up and away from the bottom and\nit unsnaps. And now we're going to take off the screen\njust so we don't damage it while we're removing the battery. It's pretty simple, there's just four screws\naround the outside of the little metal bracket. I'm undoing each of those right now. Make sure not to bend the screen past ninety\ndegrees or it will damage the cables. Any parts that you need for those will be\ndown in the video description below, tools batteries, if you need anything else just\nask me in the comments, I usually respond pretty quick. So now I'm going to take off these three ribbon\ncable connectors. This one's for the speaker on the screen. This next one is for the LCD on the screen,\nand then this last one is for the digitizer on the screen, which is the part where you\ntouch and it recognizes where your finger is. Now the screen is off, you can just kind of\nsee the back of it here. You have the earpiece with your cameras and\neverything, and then you have your fingerprint sensor on the home button. Now take out the battery. There are two screws holding on this metal\nbracket that holds the battery connector in place. So I'm going to take off this screw. Keep it separate from the other screws you\ntook off it earlier cause they are different lengths. And I'm going to remove this bracket and set\nit next to the screws so I know which one goes in which hole. And I'm going to take my pry tool and lift\nup on the little latch, you can see the three pin connector right there. And now I flip the phone around and I'm going\nto start prying down from the top of the battery. Just kind of using the frame as leverage and\npushing my pry tool underneath the battery so I'm not doing a whole lot of pulling up\non the frame or the back, I'm more just sliding the tool underneath. And that un-sticks it from the two strands\nof sticky tape that you'll see here in just a second. Then just kind of wiggle the battery loose\nand the battery is now free from the iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c battery is\ninterchangeable. I will list the iPhone 5s battery below though\nbecause it is the bigger battery, it will last longer. Anyway, press it down into place inside the\nphone, make sure it's completely flat. And put the three-pin connector back into\nplace and the metal bracket back on top. Screwing it back in. If you have any questions you can either leave\nthem in the comments or you can always hit me up on Twitter or Facebook, I'll put links\nat the end of the video for that. Now we're going to reattach the screen, starting\nwith the digitizer cable. Just kind of clip that into place. It's just kind of like Legos. You'll just have to position it with your\nfinger and then you'll hear a snap as it goes in. Be gentle though. We want to break the least amount of stuff\npossible when we open these phones up. Hopefully nothing. You can see me struggle a little bit with\nthis last one, it's takes a second to figure out where the connection actually is. And then I'm going to put the bracket back\ninto place, grabbing each of the screws that I laid out before, remembering where they\nwent, I usually lay the screws out around the bracket next to the hole they go in. Once again any parts for this can be found\nin the video description below. Amazon is usually the cheapest place to get\nbatteries and stuff, so I'll put a link there. Now the fun part. The little ribbon cable for the thumb print\nreader or finger print reader is pretty hard to get back into place. You have to line it up kind of with your finger\nfirst and then take your plastic pry tool and just kind of gently press it into place. It takes a while, you're going to love it. So now that that's clicked in you have your\nlittle bracket and you set that into place just sitting kind of on top of it. Make sure it's oriented in the right direction,\nand you can press it or click it back down into place with your finger. Takes a second to get it all lined up. And that's what it looks like when it's all\npressed down into place, so it'll clip in on both sides and hold that ribbon cable in\nvery securely. Then line the top of the screen up with the\nframe and kind of clip it up on the sides, being careful not to press it too hard in\nthe center of the screen, we don't want to crack it. And it will clip back into place. And you can see that it's completely flush\nwith the phone again. And then at this point I like to turn it on\njust to make sure everything's working so I don't have to jump back in, just in case\nI forgot to connect any cables or anything like that. If you have any questions, make sure to leave\nthem in the comments section below, and then also don't forget to get those bottom two\nscrews in. I put up videos pretty regularly. I get my hands on pretty new technology pretty\nquick, so if you have any questions or anything, if you want to subscribe make sure to click\nhere, and hit me up on Google+, Twitter, and Facebook.

      "title": "Extreme Phone Repair - Incredibly Difficult &amp; Tiny - iPhone 5 Pry Damage Micro-Soldering Repair",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another huge freeze video in this video i'm going to be attempting a very complicated micro soldering repair to this iphone 5. i'm going to try and repair pry damage caused by a previous housing replacement it is an older phone but as someone who's just starting out with micro soldering it's best to start with something cheap or something you already have this iphone 5 fits both of these categories both the home and power buttons don't work even after replacement this means the only way to power on or wake the phone from sleep is to plug in the charger very inconvenient i received this phone in a lot of devices i paid 50 dollars for an absolute bargain as it included a gold-plated iphone 5. the logic board that was installed in it at the time was this ios 7.0.4 board with no home or power button function in that previous video i replaced both the power and home buttons to no avail even directly shorting the home button pins with tweezers did nothing so i put that board aside hoping to one day fix it five months later i've just picked up a camera microscope which is required to do this pry damage repair it sounded like a great first project with my new equipment firstly i'll need to open up the damaged phone i did assemble the board into its original housing which was included in the lot but it's not complete as it wasn't any screws holding the display in place it can be lifted up using a suction cup and some plastic picks missing several parts inside but that makes disassembling it easier i'll unplug and remove the battery before detaching the display for this repair we don't have to disassemble the phone much further however i will need to remove this interconnect cable so we can get access to the components behind the sim tray as i suspected we have some board damage in this area bringing things up closer under the microscope we can see there's an attached chip floating around inside as well as another that's completely missing once i get a hold of the loose chip we can take a closer look at it this ic is known as the u3 chip and its presence on the board is vital for power and home button functionality in terms of size here's what it looks like compared to a grain of rice and a single crystal of sugar this component is microscopical however we aren't able to reuse this one as two of its solder pads are missing at this point you may also be wondering how does pry damage occur well it's caused by improper removal of the battery often the removal tabs break and people try prying the battery out by wedging their tool against the logic board thinking if the tab was there it must be okay however what happens is they knock off tiny components like the ones we discovered earlier as we need a replacement chip i'll need to get one from a donor phone this silver one has extreme water damage although it turns on there's no image on the screen so i'll harvest its u3 chip next to that chip is the dz-101 rf its purpose is to protect the sim card from electrostatic it's completely missing on the phone we're trying to fix although it's not necessary for the phone to function and its absence will not be noticed i started by adding flux to the board before trying to add a small amount of low mount solder to the pads on the chip in an effort to make it come off easier i then hit it with 280 degrees of hot air in the hopes it would come free i didn't want the temperature to be too high as it might damage the plastic on the sim reader my first attempt was a failure so i added some more solder and tried again this time the chip broke free given it also had a pad underneath complicated its removal inspecting the chip reveals a bit of damage around the edges as i have no idea what way it's supposed to be installed i'm going to just have to leave it off as installing it the wrong way around will prevent sim cards from being detected but it's time for the star of the show to come out the u3 chip i'll apply what i've learned from removing the last one to hopefully do a better job this time after all practice makes perfect using plenty of flux i added some low melt solder paste using a soldering iron before removing the chip with hot air the chip came off without issue however i didn't like the look of it so i wanted to have one last shot using another donor board at the beginning i was using tiny blue tweezers but i found the needle nose ifixit tweezers much more sturdy accurate and less prone to having the chip go flying away and given these chips are less than a millimeter big they are hard to find if you lose them this time i was happy with the remove chip so it's time we got it reattached to our original logic board before doing so i'll need to clean off the solder pads on both the board and chip itself to the best of my abilities the best method would be to remove all the old solder and apply new solder however as i found this repair difficult enough i don't want to risk damaging the pads until i get more comfortable with working at such a tiny level we're only going for functional not the cleanest best job possible it's fair to say i spent a good amount of time trying to find components that have blown off the end of my tweezers thankfully they never got too far away and i was able to retrieve them with the chip in place it's time to get it soldered down which is easier said than done i'd estimate it took me about 30 to 40 minutes i had my hot air station set at 380 degrees which is enough to slightly melt the back of the sim reader but not enough to cause any functional damage to it with one problem solved i'd caused another one of the nearby capacitors had come free after i'd knocked it with my tweezers which is incredibly easy to do i thought attaching the ic was difficult but this capacitor is even smaller the biggest problem i was facing was positioning it over the solder pads you have to remember we are talking about moving a component a quarter of the size of a crystal of sugar a few micrometers it's really hard i tried soldering it in place using an iron but that was just too big and kept causing the component to move around in the end i found it was lacking solder so adding more to both ends allowed the component to snap into position when heated with hot air and with that our capacitor is back into position i did also knock an ic to the left of the u3 chip however it only has three pads one of them being a long one on the bottom so while it doesn't look the best it'll be perfectly fine now that we've soldered everything we need to we can clean everything off with alcohol i also noticed the connector for the charging port had come off of its cable i must have unintentionally hit it at some point with some hot air nevertheless i can remove the connector and reinstall a new charging port later on however what's most important is testing out our phone i'll reconnect the display and battery and press that power button unfortunately nothing happened does that mean we fried the entire phone or does the power button and home button still not work i'll try another battery and a new charging port to see if that makes any difference connecting it to the charger this time we get a battery flat icon i'll short out the home button terminals to see whether or not the home button is functioning surprisingly the phone lit up again with the battery flat icon but i'm still getting no response from the power button after letting the phone charge up for a little it booted right up but i'm still getting the same result at least the home button function is back but i haven't given up yet i want to try a new power button cable i have no idea if the one in the housing even works after attaching a new cable it seems we have indeed restored the power button functionality too my newbie micro soldering job might not be the prettiest but it actually works and this phone once again has working power and home button functionality that was the hardest soldering job i've done so far but hopefully with time i'll get even better and fix a few newer devices but i think it's time this logic board goes back into the housing it was destined for the 24 karat gold casing as that housing is fully complete all i'll have to do is swap across the motherboard from this frame into the gold one and with the iphone 5 that couldn't be any easier with only a few screws and cables the board can come free now i'll get to disassembling the gold phone it does already have a logic board installed although it's locked and was only ever a placeholder until i found one to replace it with as the casing is plated in gold i'll need to take extra care when opening it avoiding sliding the pick around the edges and instead just using it to level the display open once the battery is disconnected i can unfasten the display's bracket and remove the several flex cables attaching the display to the logic board inside the phone with the battery out of the way it's now time to remove the logic board from the device this process will be undertaken just like the other phone the only difference is this one has all of its screws and brackets in place once the board is free it's still attached with one antenna cable underneath that'll need to be detached before it can be fully removed from the frame and we can attach our ios 7.0.4 board that we've just repaired using some micro soldering carefully weaving it through all of the cables it can be seated down into position i'll seat the led flash and camera into their correct spots before fastening all of the screws and brackets back onto the logic board proceeding i can install the sim card tray before connecting all of the remaining flex cables back onto the logic board it's important to fasten the interconnect cable before attaching the volume and power button flex cable as it'll need to run underneath that cable once that's all done it's time for the display while the screen on here isn't cracked it's a very low after-market quality display with four colors as i have a replacement i might as well install it but before i can do so i'll need to remove the home button earpiece flex cable and display bracket to transfer to the new display as it didn't come with any of these parts already added as the iphone 5 lacks any biometric security it has no paired home button or any other user replaceable parts for that matter unfortunately i wasn't able to get a refurbished display panel as these aren't available on the market anymore at least from what i can tell so if you want an original display panel you'll likely have to pull it off another phone so this is unfortunately an aftermarket panel but hopefully it'll be better than the one that was already on this gold phone so that the home button doesn't spin around you can add a small bead of liquid adhesive around the perimeter of the original gasket to help hold it in place or if you have it a replacement gasket nothing makes the repair look worse than a wonky or crooked home button i'll also take this opportunity to clean off our home button before reattaching it into our new display panel once the plastic button is installed we can attach the mechanism that goes behind it afterwards our display assembly is complete it can be cleaned off with a microfiber cloth before being reattached into the phone proceeding the battery can be installed into the phone before the remaining brackets are attached with that i can clean off the insides of the phone with a microfiber cloth to remove any dust or fingerprints before attaching the display into our gold plated housing after firmly pressing it down into position the two pentalobe screws can be reinstalled into the bottom of the iphone after which the plastic protective film can be removed from our new display panel now all that's left to do is install a tempered glass screen protector and we're done so this is it my first complex micro soldering repair was a success we were able to resurrect this iphone 5 that had fallen victim to pry damage and installed it into a gold-plated housing this was definitely the hardest repair i've undertaken so far it was a great experience although i couldn't recommend anyone undertake this themselves if you have an issue like this yourself just take it to a professional this phone has no icloud account but is locked with a passcode as i don't want to update the phone and apple doesn't allow you to reinstall older ios versions i'll have to get the passcode i removed the disabled screen and tried the passcodes the seller thought it might have been but none worked i also tried a few common ones too without success as there's 10 000 possible combinations it's going to take a while but don't worry i'll crack away at it and on that note this has been a huge jeffries video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the micro soldering playlist for more videos just like this one and if you're looking for any used devices be sure to check out my online store link for which is down the description

      "title": "Replace your iPhone 5 battery in 2 Minutes",
      "transcript": "Today I am going to show you how to take apart\nthe iPhone 5 and replace the battery. It is actually pretty simple, there are only\n4 screws total that you have to take out. First make sure that you turn off your iPhone. Then there are 2 screws down at the bottom. These are a Pentalobe screw. So you will need a special screw driver to\nremove them. It is the same screw driver that you can use\non the iphone 4 or 4s, it will also work for the iphone 5. Once you get the 2 screws out, Take your suction\ncup (The bigger the better) And clip it onto the screen. Then using a plastic non marring tool, you\ncan kind of pry away the screen from the base. I personally, think it is a little easier\nto use a razor blade, But using a razor will leave a few little scratches on the bottom\nof your device, Only lift the screen up 90 degrees. Because you can see right there the ribbon\ncables might tear if you fold it farther back. There is two screws right here on this metal\nbit, holding the battery cable in place to the motherboard. Take off these two screws. They are just your regular small Philips head\nscrew. Take off the metal bracket, then you can unclip\nthe little black cable. It is kind of like a Lego piece that clamps\nin. And then grab the tab that says \"Certified\npersonnel only\" And lift out the battery. Take your new battery and clip it in place\nto the mother board, just like a little Lego. Snap it in. Take your metal bracket and then screw the\nsame 2 little screws back into place. And remember that the replacement batteries\ncan be found on Amazon.com, usually they are pretty cheap. Ill put a link in the video description below\nso you can find that link easily. And then clamp the screen back on. Make sure you put back the 2 bottom screws\ninto the phone as well. (The Pentalobe ones.) There you go, youve replaced the battery!! Dont forget to 'like' if this video helped\nyou. And dont forget to subscribe! It really does help me out, And for those\nwho need them, I did post a link for the batteries in the video description below. So ya, thanks for watching!",

      "title": "iPhone 5 Back Glass &amp; Camera Lens Replacement Easy!",
      "transcript": "Alright, today I’m going to show you how\nto replace the glass pieces on the back of the iPhone 5 along with the rear camera lens. Pretty straight forward. All the parts and tools you’ll need for\nthis project are in the video description. Grab a heat gun or your grandmother’s hair\ndryer and heat up the top of the phone. You want to heat up the glass and the glue\nunderneath. So you’d spend about 30 seconds to a minute\nheating up the glass. I usually wait until it’s a little bit too\nhot to touch. That way I know the glass and the adhesive\nunderneath are hot enough that they will separate. I take a razor, but you can also use a pry\ntool and grab underneath the edge of the glass. Mine’s kind of shattered, but you can also\ngo between the frame and the edge of the glass. It’s really important that you don’t slide\nyour razor too far underneath, and if you do, take the edge of the razor and press it\nup into the glass so you don’t slice through any of the important ribbon cables underneath. It’s a pretty straight forward process and\nas long as you stay near the edge of the glass piece you should be fine. I’ll show you where the little ribbon cable\nis at here in a second. As I’m lifting up the glass, I’ll hold\nit down so it doesn’t rip with the adhesive as I’m pulling the piece up. Now that the little ribbon cable is safe I\ncan pull the away the glass piece. And you’ll see the camera lens come up and\naway with it as well cuz the adhesive is attached to the top of the camera lens. If I had to do it again I would just get a\nnew camera lens. This one I’m just going to clean out cuz\nI don’t have any laying around. And then once you get your new camera lens\nor the one you cleaned, just press it back into place. There are these little holes up in the top\ncorner and the bottom corner and then you click it down into place on top of the phone. Pretty easy. With the adhesive you want to be really careful\nbecause the adhesive is really thin and it’s easy to tear. You can see the clear part right there as\nit peels away from the adhesive itself. If you do manage to tear your adhesive or\nruin it at all you can just kind of cut up the leftover strips and place it where you\nneed to. You just basically want it all around the\noutside so that dust can’t get inside on your lens anymore. Press it down into place then you can lift\nup the backing with a razor blade and you should be good to go. Grab that top last piece. Take off the protective covering. Once again these replacement parts you can\nfind in the video description below. And then press it in. And you can see all around the top it is pretty\nflush with the phone itself. It would be near impossible to tell if this\nphone was ever fixed by anybody else. It greatly increases the resale value of your\nphone, especially since the parts are so cheap. If you have any questions leave them in the\ncomments. Don’t forget to subscribe, it does help\nme out a lot. Thanks for watching!",

      "transcript": "this is the full take apart repair guide for the Motorola Droid Razer HD brought to you by repairs Universe to perform this repair we're going to use a few tools including the safe open pry tool the Torx T5 screwdriver Torx T3 screwdriver and if we're replacing the screen assembly we're going to suggest using fresh adhesive strips to begin the repair we're going to make sure the device is fully powered off then we're going to use a SIM card removal tool or a paperclip to press a small hole near the SIM card tray and remove it on the bottom of the device here we're going to have two Torx T5 screws that we're going to need to remove once that's done we can then shimmy the screen assembly forward as you can see here this will release the clips you want to be very careful though as it's the screen assembly is still going to be attached with two jaw bone connectors one on the top here and one on the bottom just going to get our pry to underneath here we're just going to shimmy this down a little bit more so we have a little bit more room just going to release this tab and then slide out the flex cable going to do the same thing here with the the bottom just going to get a PRI tool underneath release that black tab just gently lifting it up that will allow us to slide the flex cable right out of the connection once both the connections are released we then able to safely separate the motherboard assembly here on the left and the screen assembly here on the right to begin removing the screen assembly from the front housing we're going to remove two Torx T3 screws located up here then going to use our safe open pry tool and gently lift up on this metal cover it should just be held in place with a few clips and the screws so once those are removed should pop out very easily we're now going to gently release this Flex cable located on the top here this is going to include the ear speaker the front camera and the proximity sensor so we just going to gently lift up it's going to be held in place with just a little bit of adhesive just going to peel it back here and we can then remove it from the device if you're looking just to replace this front camera all we'll need to do is release this jaw connector and replace the front camera but back to the screen assembly here we're going to use our heat gun or hairdryer we're just going to begin warming the top here of the screen assembly we're going to use a medium heat couple inches away from the device this is just going to help release that adhesive make it much more malleable so we're use a pry tool to gently lift the screen assembly out also going for focus a little bit of heat down here on the flex cables and then onto the front should take about 45 seconds to thoroughly heat the device once it's properly heated we're just going to use a safe open pry tool and begin releasing this Flex cable from the housing it's held on with pretty strong adhesive so just continue working your way around as you can see we're just going to lift up and continue working our way around here just trying to attempt to release the rest of that Flex cable and there we go it's going to fold it down we're then going to start using our safe open pry tool we're just going to hit it on the side here the adhesive is not very strong holding the screen assembly in place so it should be pretty simple to either get in up here in NE speaker assembly or on the sides you want to be very careful though not to damage the front houses we just going to slide our pry tool along the sides here releasing all the adhesive this process does take some time so just slowly work your way around be sure to reheat the screen assembly if the adhesive begins to get too strong as you can see this adhesive is coming off quite nicely on the screen assembly we just need to focus down here we'll make sure to slide those Flex cables just going to reheat it real quick just add a little bit more Touch of heat majority of the adhesive is on the top and bottom so Focus your heat there as you can see with that added heat that heer just cuts through just like butter there we go we're just going to slide that Flex cable all the way through the housing at this point you can then replace your screen assembly Focus back on the motherboard now we're going to have release this bottom connection here which is going to be your battery it's always smart to release the power source first so we're just going to remove that tape use your safe open pry tool and just lift up on that battery connection and move it to the side now the batter is fully disconnected we're going to use our Torx T5 screwdriver and release the 10 T5 screws Loc throughout the motherboard as shown in that diagram to the left all these screws will be the same size so you just put them in a big pile and not have to worry about them getting mixed up with all the screws removed we just have a few connections here to release we're going to start in the top left here to release the loudspeaker this going to be held in place with a wire connector but first we're going to have to remove this small piece of plastic cover now I'm going to try to use my safe open pry tool to lift up on the connection it's just too small so we're just use my flathead screwdriver and lift the connection out there we go back to my safe home pry tool I'm going to remove that casing right there and lift up on the main camera top here we're just going to release that cable and there we go the motherboard can now safely be removed we suggest prying on this left side here gently fold the motherboard to the right there we go motherboard can now safely be removed on the motherboard we're just going to have this main camera right here which is just held in place of the jaob bone connector we also have the headphone jack Flex cable there next step is going to be removing the battery to do this we're going to use a safe open pry tool and just begin working our way around the battery it is held in place with a very strong adhesive so take your time you do not want to bend the battery in any way or cause any damage to it I'm just going to get underneath it here and once all the adhesive is released the battery can then be removed and replaced be sure to check us out at repairs universe.com where you'll find all the tools

      "title": "iPhone 4s Screen Fix and Repair. COMPLETE w/ PDF Screw chart FREE",
      "transcript": "One of the hardest parts about replacing the\nscreen on the 4 or 4s is staying organized. So I made this sweet little paper that will\nhelp you stay organized. You can download it directly from my blog\nby clicking the bottom left hand corner. One little tricked I’ve learned is to put\na piece of tape over the cracked screen. It will keep shards of glass from going everywhere. I will link replacement screens in the video\ndescription below so it’s easier for everybody to find the good ones. If you have any questions or anything, leave\nthem in the comments. I respond fairly regularly. Turn the phone off it you can and then take\nout the SIM card. As you can see this tutorial is going to be\npretty straight forward; no fluff, as quick as possible. Take out the two bottom screws. They are a pentalobe screw driver. You can see the tools in the video description\nbelow. The back slides up and then pops right off. I’m going to go ahead and put that on my\nhandy dandy little paper. Two screws holding the battery bracket in\nand once that’s done, grab the little black piece and you better believe there’s a slot\non the paper for this as well. Keep everything organized. Then you lift the little bracket up and that\nun-connects the battery and you pull up on the little pull tab. If the pull tab breaks, which I’ve had happen\nbefore, just pry the battery out. It’s held in place by a little bit of glue. Place that on the paper. And then I just fold the tab over so it stays\nout of my way. There’s a little shield holding the charging\nport connector. Take that shield off. There’s a spot for the screws as well. And then there’s a top shield; four screws. Lift that up and out. There are two little slots in the bottom holding\nit onto the motherboard. Place that on your little paper. And then the camera. It’s like a little Lego. You lift up on that little bottom piece and\nit unclips. Take the camera, put it on the paper. And then there are some ribbon cables. Kind of like Legos; just lift up and away-\ngently always. These are to the screen, the digitizer and\nthe LCD. And then there’s this little black sticker\ncovering up this little screw that we have to also remove. Once that screw is gone there will be a little\ngold piece that we also need to not lose. Place it on your paper. And another screw over here for another bracket. This itty bitty bracket will come up and away\nfrom the board and you have to remove that before you can start on the motherboard. Another little connecter and then we’re\ngoing to bend up this other black part over here just to give us a little bit more room\nto work with. Three more ribbon cables down along the bottom,\nwell, and the center of the motherboard. And then we’re going to lift up the charging\nport connector. Just kind of fold it up and out of our way. Two screws holding down the bottom speaker. Put that on the paper. Also the little black triangle. There’s a slot for everything. And then this wire cable just clips up and\naway from the main board. And then there are four screws holding on\nthe main board. Once those screws are done you can just kind\nof wiggle it out. Make sure it’s not getting caught on any\nof the ribbon cables. You want to be super gentle with those. And then the little circle-y thingy as well. There’s a slot for that on my paper. Then there are four screws in the corner of\nthe phone. It’s very important that you remove these\nbecause this is what’s holding the screen onto the frame of the iPhone. There are six other screws along the sides\nand each of these has a little washer as well so make sure to keep the washer with the screw. Now this is only for the iPhone 4: unlatch\nthat little latch and that’s for the Home button so you don’t tear the ribbon cable\non the Home button. The iPhone 4s ribbon cable is not connected\nto the Home button as you’ll see here in a second. Now the iPhone 4s screen easily pulls away\nfrom the frame. You just want to slide those ribbon cables\nthrough the little hole. Since it’s already broken it’s not too\nbig of a deal if it breaks the little heads off, but you know, be careful anyway. And now you want to get rid of every little\ntiny bit of glass that you possibly can cuz if there’s any glass in here, the screen’s\nnot going to sit tight against the frame of the phone anymore which is kind of a big deal. So clean it up as best you can and take off\nthe little plastic piece on the new screen and slide it into place. You want to keep those cables up at the top\nas straight as possible. Keep in mind as well that the CDMA and the\nGSM have differently spaced frame brackets. You can see that the ribbon cables up top\nare not bent in any way, they just slide straight in. If you feel like your cables are too short,\nchances are you bent one of them. Now that it’s in place it sits flush with\nno glass in-between the screen and the frame. And now I need to get my Home button up in\nthere. I’m taking it off of the old screen, just\npeeling it away. Getting all the extra glass off of there and\nthen popping it right into its little slot. And now we’re going to put it all back together. Four screws in the corner. Make sure they’re all tight. Six screws along the sides, also make sure\nthey’re tight with the little washers in place. And that the screen is sitting flat against\nthe frame. And then you take the main board and slide\nit in the little grooves. It will sit completely flat against the bottom\nof the phone. Make sure there are no wire cables or anything\nelse pinched underneath. And then grab your little circle-y device\nand slide that in as well. And then there’s going to be four screws\naround the outside of the main board. Grab your loud speaker, pop that into place. Put the top of the speaker in first and then\ndrop the bottom of the speaker down and then you can wrap the wire cable around. Be really really careful when you’re putting\nthis into place, when you’re clipping it in, that you don’t bend any of the sides. Now you put your little black triangle into\nplace and screw both of those in. And then you can fold over the charging port\ncable. Clip that back into place. Get the itty bitty bracket on top of the little\nscrew hole. Screw it back in. Get the gold bracket next to the camera. Place that in place. Screw it in. And get the camera in there; click it in like\na little Lego. You’ll definitely know when it clicks in. And then start folding over the ribbon cables. These are the LCD and digitizer cables. And then you have three more. Start with the shortest one and then get the\nother ones in place. And then the top shield clips in with the\nbottom two brackets and then there are four screws around the outside. One more shield covering the charging port\ncable. Left up your little tab and get the battery\nin place. Make sure not to pinch any of the cables as\nyou’re sliding it in. I like to put the top in first. Take that little black bracket, get that into\nplace and then screw in the two screws holding the battery in place. And get the back on there. Two screws for the pentalobe screws, and the\nphone works. If you have any questions make sure to leave\nthem in the comments below. If I helped you in any way, shape or form,\nplease subscribe. It does help me out a lot. You can also hit me up on Facebook, Twitter\nor Google Plus. And then check out my blog. I post stuff regularly. I have a lot of fun doing it. Thanks for watching.

about anywhere we're also going to need a standard screwdriver which is necessary to remove a couple finicky screws a plastic spudger which can be found online for 99 cents and a paper clip to remove the SIM tray first you need to power off your device by doing this we will ensure that no data is lost when we pull the battery cord in just a minute additionally you're going to need that paper clip we talked about to remove the SIM tray simply stick it in the hole on the side of the device and pop it out yes you do need to do this even if you don't have a SIM card in there because the tray locks into the motherboard and without it it will be impossible to disassemble the phone now take your fancy new pentalobe screwdriver please ensure that it's a pentalobe screwdriver or else you will strip the screws down here on the bottom now as you notice they're not very tight even when Apple puts a mom so take note to that when you're putting them back on the threading is very very thin and so they're very easy to strip take your time and make sure that they go in and out nice without over stress once you've done that take both thumbs and turn the device around and slide up with the panel you'll hear a little bit of a click and you can pull off the panel completely there are two screws securing the battery connector to the logic board and all you have to do remove those is use your phillips double-0 screwdriver to get rid of both of those screws once you've taken those off and placed them aside in order so you don't lose them take your little plastic spudger pull upwards on the left side of the connector which will allow you to disconnect the battery from the motherboard as you can see there's this a little tab here but it's very easy to bend in crinkle and if Apple checks that out they're going to know you got in the phone so I use this plastic spudger to simply pry the battery up as it is it he's making it easier to remove it and ensuring that it doesn't look like you've been toying around inside your phone there's an insider tip place the battery aside now it comes time to remove that little black metal piece and place that aside with your screws and now we need to remove the antenna diode and cable which is sitting right there take your little plastic spudger and simply disconnect the diode from the cable and as you can see there's a little bit of a hook simply undo the cable and make sure it's out of the way okay see this metal plate groovy me - there's two screws that you need to remove they are different sizes so be sure to keep track of them the larger one contrary to what you might think is on the left side of the device or the outside of the device place those two screws aside once you've removed them once you remove those two screws the plate is ready to come out it might be ever so slightly at he's but don't be worried to give it a little bit of a tug it's easier than your virgin 40-year old gym teacher for camera angles sake I'm going to turn the device around so you can see me yank this little cable up grab your plastic spudger and it is a connector that you can remove very easily now the cable is actually at he's to the logic board so you will have to give it a little bit of some force and pressure but be very careful with it as it's very prone to tearing boom we're on the bottom of the device as you can see there's one and two screws underneath that cable we just pulled up it need to be removed they come out pretty easily take your time no rush now underneath the screw that's underneath the cable you're going to find a little steel 30-60-90 triangle piece I called the black pizza piece don't worry it's supposed to come out just place it aside we'll put it back and later now that we've removed the two screws holding the bottom in all we have to do is pull it out and place it aside there are some copper conductors on the bottom beware of those because they do break easily now we get to our buddy the EMI shield now this thing's a little bit of a bugger to pull out so be sure to remove these four screws in the right order because they are different sizes and will need to be put back exactly as they were pulled out so keep track of them this is the last area we need to address before we can get to the EMI shield and get to some fun where we can pop out a bunch of different connectors now there is this Phillips screw right here that does need to be removed because we're going to be working in this area a little bit longer now that screw was holding this little plate in place and it's actually a conductor that goes pretty well deep into the phone so take you a little plastic spudger and just kind of pull it up at a 45 degree angle so you can grab it with your fingers and grab the little brass connectors out from underneath the display we're so close to the magic behind the EMI shield and there's only one connector standing in the way that's this little guy right here which is actually another antenna diode which needs to be removed with your plastic spudger yay now it's time to remove the EMI shield but don't get too excited because it's the hardest thing to take out see that that is a very very thin ribbon cable and that right there is a hook now you do have to pull the EMI shell towards you in order to get that released but that cable is there and is very prone to tearing so be very careful when you remove the EMI shield april fools we're not quite ready you do need to take your standard flat-head screwdriver to remove this little screw which is actually a screw that allows you to plug a screw into it screw ception no homo so once you've removed this and please do so very carefully because it's near some very sensitive components that can be scratched or a brazed you can see what a weird little screw it is and you're ready to unplugging the fun stuff Teta - time for the fun stuff okay so this is the first cable that needs to be removed please ensure that it is removed first the order after this first one doesn't really matter but this one does need to come up first don't ask why it just needs to be done no actually I'll tell you it's because this cable right here the second one is beneath the first one so you need to remove the first one to remove the second one novel a okay now the third cable actually is the whole camera assembly so if your camera comes out or flies out of your device don't worry just place the camera assembly aside that's supposed to happen Kable number four is a little guy and should come out with ease which gives us cable number five to be left with now this is a long one but wait I said six cables yes because underneath cable number five is a very tiny cable number six make sure you pull this out if you don't it will make for a very unpleasant time when pulling out the logic port okay we're up near the camera and as you can see there's this little black piece of adhesive it looks like I would assume this is to indicate whether or not the device has been tampered with therefore determining your warranty so make sure you really want to proceed after this step but there is a screw beneath it that does need to be removed this little piece of plastic can be reused and put back on like it was never taken off so do take good care of it because we can fix it later on once you place the black adhesive aside you have this singular screw that you have to deal with it's easy gator done Ceyda and so we got another one of those weird little screws that we have to use our standard flathead screwdriver for again it's by some pretty sensitive areas so take your time be careful there's nothing to rush about now there are two more screws that need to be removed their standard Phillips screws so you can get your Phillips doubles of your screwdriver back there's one right here by the a5 chip and there's one right here hiding in the depths of the iPhone huzzah we've removed the three screw so all we have to do now is make sure the cables are out of the way and pull out the logic board now it came out for me with ease if you're having a lot of trouble make sure that you took the sim tray out because if you didn't take the sim tray out it's attached to the logic board so when you pull this out obviously it's not going to come out of the frame if the sim card slot is in so make sure you're aware of that oh hi braiding motor how we despise you unlike everything else which is very nicely screwed the vibrating motor is at least and boy does it take a lot of prime to get it out now check that out see that that's folded over adhesive make sure yours is not like that it's going to make it a lot harder to put back on during reassembly Merry Christmas this is the most time-consuming part you have ten screws that need to be removed three on each side and four in the corner a lot of them are very very tight so be careful and don't strip them because that will make for a lot harder removal wouldn't it be nice if these were easy screws yeah well tough crap because they come out easily but they also have a washer which makes them incredibly sucky when you reassemble but you do need them and you have to keep track of them tough beans no hey it's good to see you we're up by the camera see that screw right there no it's actually for the sleep/wake switch so don't remove that apple's back in full force with that mysterious black tape so you do need to remove the black tape so you can remove the last of the four corner screws and we're already assuming that you removed the six other screws so remove those there's a Phillips beneath you we're good to go alright we're ready to remove the digitizer from the iPhone 4 steel frame what you have to do is take your little plastic spudger and insert it in between the plastic here and the actual band now if you're struggling I'd use a heat gun for no more than five seconds total on each corner so that you can kind of loosen things up when you throw the new display and please make sure that these two cables are at the fullest length if you crimp either of these two cables it's going to be extremely difficult for you to not only reassembling your device but furthermore you might damage the brand new screen if you're not particularly snazzy at performing tasks backwards we don't blame you and because of this we've provided a reassembly video for your advantage click the on-screen annotation to begin that being said we do recommend that once your iPhone is back in one piece that you test all of its functions before putting

      "title": "IOS 7.1.1 iPhone 4s Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another video in today's video when we were storing this iPhone 4s on iOS 7.1.1 shout-out to Aiden on Twitter at asj Palms for sending this in to me now I did have an iPhone 4s on iOS 7.0.4 but I did have to update after it failed a jailbreak now it actually has iCloud activation on so I put it in recovery and updated so what is running iOS 9 and is still able to use it in things but it's still a cloud locked but this one is an iCloud locked and is running iOS 7.1.1 so you get the new animations so the iOS 7 iPhone 4s will be the last piece of the puzzle for my iPhone 4s is on every version of iOS now also have a I phone 4s on every version of iOS which that is iOS 4 5 6 & 7 but you can see here taking it out of the box it was shipped in it's got a smashed back quite badly actually and the front isn't too bad but it does have a fair bit of missing glass up at the top then you can see here that it powers on you can see that it is running iOS 7.1.1 and it is a 16 gigabyte iPhone 4s we're gonna be putting parts on it from this iPhone 4s which is a light cloud locked on iOS 6.1.3 I've brought it on eBay for a total of 11 dollars so you can see here with this iPhone 4s on 7.1.1 that it continuously turns on even after you turn it off and that is definitely related to the dock connector so because we're gonna be swapping this out with another logic board that won't be an issue anymore because I otherwise I'll have to change the dock connector the LCD and obviously the batteries and all that which is a bit of a pain so what we're going to go ahead and do is just change the logic board and then we'll get all the good parts from the other phone now the other phone is iCloud lock like I said so it's no use and I only paid $11 for it on eBay the screen on the other phone is a little bit more scratched up than the one on this phone but like this one has giant cracks in it which doesn't look very good in my collection so I'm gonna go ahead and change that screen now I wasn't going to buy a brand new screen because to get a good quality iPhone 4 and 4s screen they retail for around 30 to 40 dollars here in Australia now did buy one of those for my 24 karat gold iPhone 4 because I wanted that thing looking absolutely spectacular but because this is only an iPhone 4s and these things are quite cheap now to buy anyway I'm just going to be putting on a screen that I already have I'm also changing the back because the back glass is completely shattered on this phone with one that isn't broken and is actually I think brand new so we're going to be going ahead and doing that in this video so overall it's a very easy process on the iPhone 4 and 4s to remove the logic boards it's not a whole lot involved there's a lot of tiny screws and things like that but the often Falls and foresters are great phones to work on if you're starting out on repairing phones or you just want to mess around with phones because they're cheap and if you break them you know they don't cost very much and they are kind of hard to break I've never actually broken one and I've pulled heaps and heaps of these apart you've just got to make sure you remove all the screws and everything like that so there is dedicated guides online to do that so if you need to know you know what screws to take out and things like that this is just an overview of restoring this phone this isn't a step-by-step guide there's plenty of those online if you are looking at actually repairing one of these now I've gone ahead and removed the logic board out of the iOS 7.1.1 housing that was in and now I'm going to be doing the same process on this other iPhone 4s which is iCloud locked 16 gig on iOS 6.1.3 I did downgrade it I think it was on I was on nine point three point five when I got it but I thought I'd downgrade it just in case any vulnerabilities came out in iOS 6.1.3 you can see here this is all the parts out of the iPhones you can see how I lay them out and put the screws next to where the screws would come out of say the battery there we've got the screws next to the battery so I know where everything goes when I put everything back together so now it's just reverse of what we did before I've swapped the boards over to the other phone so the 7.1.1 is now in where the iCloud lock board was and now I just have to go ahead and screw all that back down in some cases that's actually cheaper on just swapping a logic board with another phone than it is buying all the parts individually so when you're fixing up a phone make sure that the cost of the new screen all the new parts don't actually exceed just buying a locked one or one that's not working and then being able to just swap the boards with buying those phones you got to make sure obviously the screens actually work and it's not water damaged otherwise you could end up with water damaged screens and broken batteries and things like and things like that if you want to take the safe route you can always just buy the parts new but like I said if you want to cut costs you can get parts used from phones and things like that and that's where I get some of my parts from my by like in bulk like old repair shops they just shut down or they just stopped repairing iPhone 4s and flores's so they get rid of all their parts and then I'll try and get those and then put them to good use in phones and things like that now that we've gone ahead and swapped over the logic boards in these two phones we can go ahead and reinstall the back glass this is a brand new one with a tempered glass screen protector on it to prevent it from scratches and we go ahead and test out the phone in the new housing you can see here that it's still functional and you can see now it's not on iOS 6 and iCloud locked it's on iOS 7.1.1 this is also a 16 gigabyte iPhone 4s the iPhone 4s shipped in 2011 and came with 8 16 32 and 64 gigabytes of storage 512 megabytes of

      "summary": "Aiden on Twitter at asj Palms for sending this in to me now I did have an iPhone 4s on iOS 7.0.4 but I had to update after it failed a jailbreak. Now it actually has iCloud activation on so I put it in recovery and updated so what is running iOS 9 and is still able to use it in things but it's still a cloud locked. we're gonna be putting parts on it from this iPhone 4s which is a light cloud locked on iOS 6.1.3 I've brought it on eBay for a total of 11 dollars. The screen on the other phone is a little bit more scratched up than the one on this phone but like this one has giant cracks in it. New screen because to get a good quality iPhone 4 and 4s screen they retail for around 30 to 40 dollars here in Australia now did buy one of those for my 24 karat gold iPhone 4 because I wanted that thing looking absolutely spectacular. break I've never actually broken one and I've pulled heaps and heaps of these apart you've just got to make sure you remove all the screws and everything like that so there is dedicated guides online to do that. This is just an overview of restoring this phone this isn't a step-by-step guide there's plenty of those online if you are looking at actually repairing one of these. In some cases that's actually cheaper on just swapping a logic board with another phone than it is buying all the parts individually. So when you're fixing up a phone make sure that the cost of the new screen all the new parts don't actually exceed just buying a locked one or one that's not working. things like that and that's where I get some of my parts from my by like in bulk like old repair shops they just shut down or they just stopped repairing iPhone 4s and flores's. Now that we've gone ahead and swapped over the logic boards in these two phones we can go ahead and reinstall the back glass this is a brand new one with a tempered glass screen protector on it to prevent it from scratches. iOS 9 now have multiple phones on those versions of iOS but now I have a complete collection of at least one phone on every version of iOS the iPhone 4s can run.

      "transcript": "you're watching the samsung galaxy note 20 disassembly first before we begin we need to remove the sim tray next you're going to want to heat the back plate up using a hair dryer or a heat gun so you can loosen up the adhesive underneath and then you're going to use a plastic pry tool to pry the back plate off so here's your back plate you have one of the secondary mics over here and as you can see it's plastic once the back plate is removed there are 17 phillips screws which need to be removed all right once all your screws are removed we're going to lift up this metal plate over here and then we're going to disconnect the battery cable just pop it up once that's disconnected we can disconnect the wireless charging cable and they're going to peel the wireless charging pad off here's a better look at your wireless charging pad as you can see the coil is located in this area next let's remove the top plastic cover which has some antenna lines running through it here's a better look at that piece and your earpiece speaker is underneath it so basically the sound from the earpiece speaker travels through the opening over here in the mid frame here's a better look at the opening now let's lift up and remove the bottom speaker assembly here's a better look at that you also have some antenna lines running through it over here now let's go ahead and disconnect the rest of the cables you have this one cable over here which connects your main board to your sub board so you have this cable over here which connects your charger port to your main board as well as the sub board over here on the bottom corner there are also three phillips screws on the bottom over here two on your charger port and one on the sub board that needs to be removed now that that's removed we can remove the sub board and then we can lift up and remove the charger port so here's a better look at the charger port and the flex cable and here's your sub board which has your main microphone on it it also has some antenna contacts on there here's the back side and then your s pen cable you have one more cable over here pop that off then you have your front facing camera cable right here here's a better look at that now we're going to lift up and remove the main board so here's your main board as you can see you have a couple layers to it and here's the back side you have your sim reader over here every camera is connected right here you have graphite film over here on the back if you want to disconnect your cameras you just have to pop off the connectors and then remove them you also have your proximity sensor located over here now back to the front side you have a secondary mic over here on top you also have your flash over here and your sensor on the back now onto your screen cable there are two phillips screws over here which you need to remove that's holding down a bracket which covers this flex cable over here which connects your main board to the screen cable underneath once those screws are removed you can lift up this metal bracket and you can see over here screwing cables connected to this cable so you could separate them now your s-pen is located over here underneath this white plastic we're gonna pry that off so you can see your s pen over here and i'm going to remove it so it's flex cable over here is for the sensor for the s-pen so when you slide it in and out it knows it's in there or not here's your s-pen now as far as the battery goes there are no easy pull tabs so you're just gonna have to heat the front of the phone up so you can loosen up the adhesive underneath the battery and you have to gently work your way and pry the battery off now removing this battery isn't that simple since there isn't much room to work with so you're gonna have to gently keep applying heat and pry the battery off carefully now you can also use 99 ipa or isopropyl alcohol and you could drip some around the edges over here so it could get underneath the battery and separate the battery from the frame however if you are planning on using 99 isopropyl alcohol make sure you have gloves on and eye protection here's a better look at your battery so now you're left with just the mid frame you have a flex cable over here for your power button volume keys your vibrator mode over here on the bottom corner your cable over here for the screen which is still attached to the frame there's a water resistant rubber gasket over here with a filter for where the speaker is and if you need to remove your power button or volume keys or replace that there's a metal bracket over here the same as there was over here for the screen cable you just lift it up and then you'll have access to removing that now as far as the screen goes once you disconnect the screen cable all you have to do is heat up the front of the phone and pry the screen off it's just held on with adhesive and then you can just basically apply your new screen reconnect everything and reassemble your phone now moving on to the fingerprint reader and peel this off it's located here underneath the screen and it doesn't look like it's user replaceable so it's going to be something that's attached to the screen itself so replacing that will pretty much require replacing your screen now as far as the cooling goes instead of copper it looks like there's a 3d graphite layer you can see over here i'm not 100 sure if it's graphite but that's what i'm assuming it is all right now i'm going to go ahead and put the phone back together once everything's back in place apply new adhesive place your back plate back over flip your phone over power it on and you're done i hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you guys want to see more videos like this make sure

      "transcript": "hey what's up don't click away today i'm going to show you how we replace a crack front screen on a samsung galaxy note 20 ultra so hey what's up i'm javi guzman with mr phonedoctor.com and thank you all so much for tuning in and checking out this episode now if this is your first time here and you guys enjoy all things tech and repair related please make sure you guys hit that subscribe button and smack that bell so you're notified on our latest videos if you guys have any questions comments or suggestions or even need a screen repair please visit us at www.mrphonedoctor.com or reach us at any of our social media platforms found below all right now that we got all that out of the way what is up guys thanks once again for checking out this episode you guys are in for a treat today i'm going to be showing you guys how we replace a cracked front screen on a samsung galaxy note 20 ultra now this process will work properly fine as long as your display is fully working digitizer touch is responsive and there is very minimal bleeds or any kind of blemishes now if it does have some bleeds we can attempt this repair but it is a little more riskier because during the lamination process we do put a little bit of pressure on the oled when we're laminating the glass and oca back to the display so just keep that in mind i'm going to go ahead and show you guys what this display looks like i am going to of course plug it into our tester here and if you do want to access the test menu you can do this by dialing start pound zero star pound on any non-verizon device okay now if it is a verizon phone i'm sorry but you cannot test this setting you have to pop in another sim and change into carrier settings on it but uh let's go ahead and log in this is a t-mobile one so this will work fine uh you're going to want to just go to pound go to the phone screen like you're going to make a phone call dial star pound zero star pound and here we go this is what we have so you have several different options for you to choose from the major one we want to look at is the touch because we want to make sure that the touch and everything is uh fully responsive there is no dead zones on the digitizer and of course with this white background it makes it very very easy for you guys to spot any kind of bleeds or blemishes and things like that so you guys can see here that this one is flawless minus this hairline crack that is up here on top now first things first we do need to first create a incision point and to do that what we're going to use is we use our dot glass i did make a video on this little device and we are going to be having a giveaway so make sure you guys click up here if you guys have more information on this uh oka glass we are gonna have this available for sale on our store and of course the giveaways so stay tuned so what we're gonna want to do is we're gonna want to go ahead and put two breaks one here and one here once we have that broken we can set it to heat up so let's go ahead and begin doing the breaks so we're going to want to align the dot glass precisely right on the bezel i like to let it hit the bezel and once it hits i'm going to go ahead and drag it down that way i'm clear from any metal so we're going to go ahead and just set this in here get a little tight and i'm going to fill it go right up against the metal bezel okay so this looks good it feels good and we did it we got one break here i'm gonna do another break right on here and sometimes depending on how it breaks if you see that it goes across you don't need to do two breaks but on this one i do need to break one more so there we go you can see our two breaks right here right here and these left some beautiful spider webs which we can go ahead and clear all this out using our 9666 and their oka clear card so i'm going to go ahead and do a test real quick just to make sure everything is up and working and you can see here how everything is still responsive brakes were perfectly right on where we needed them and our touch is working good good so our next step is of course we're going to want to set this on our heating plate and temperature for all you guys asking it is 90 degrees celsius we like to use 90. let it heat up for us a good five minutes once it's hot we can begin the glass removal and i know there's a lot of you guys out there who are trying to do this i do recommend um let a professional handle this you know i make this look very very easy and it honestly is not you know it just takes a lot of practice and training to get down to the level that we're at so if you guys do need a repair please reach out to us we can definitely get that done it's not worth you guys doing a one-off repair trying this because it's going to lead to more damage and these displays aren't cheap if your damage is oled you're gonna be looking about 350 up to maybe even 450 just for the screen repair so um leave it for a professional and we can definitely get you guys all squared away with that okay so i'm gonna set this here i'm gonna cut and we'll come back here in about five minutes as soon as this gets up to temp all right the device is nice and toasty we can go in and begin removing i am going to want to go ahead and start from the two incision points that i left on top and to do that we are going to use our 9666 which works wonders i know you guys are asking where do you get this or it's expensive in my country but we do have it available in store so visit us at mrfundoctor.com and you can check out our web store and all these other tools that we use on our videos so we're good i'm going to just begin here removing this first little section and you want to be very very critical and sensitive here and you want to be very very gentle here not to damage this oled getting in here just want to gently insert the oca card on here and this will just cut all these little shards off and any little hairline splinters and stuff like that you want to get out of the way so i really hope you guys enjoying these videos it's been a while man since i've actually done one of these repair videos i've been eager to get my hands on some of these latest devices and we have finally done so so i'm gonna have some more videos coming out got the s21s lined up s21 pluses and those are gonna be pretty cool because there's actually several different methods of repairing those we could do those in frame and out of frame i just want to clear out all these little shards always want to have a nice clean work area before um continuing because these little shards they'll get in there once you start cutting and removing this glass those little guys will get in here and cause some damage they'll either scratch or polarize or even cause like dead pixels so you always want to make sure that you clear out all the little shards of glass out of here all right this one's coming along good this one did have a little more webbing and smaller shards so i'm paying a little more closer attention to this one i want to make sure that everything comes off smoothly so this does take time guys don't rush through these okay you know even us i mean sometimes removing the glass it could take up to 20 30 minutes that's just for the glass removal so for the most part it looks like we're good there we go two very clean openings right here so next we're going to go ahead and use our line and the line we're going to be using is 0.05 we like to use this one just because with these series devices the polarizer is thinner so we don't want to use too thin of a line because it will end up going underneath and clipping it causing damage to the polarizer and i do like to get a nice clean line i want to make sure that there's no kinks on it see that you can see how the line gets curly and this one's not too bad but you know other times it's just too curly cute and you don't want to work with that i'm going to start over here and it looks like there's a piece of shard and any shards broken shards once they are relieved just get them out of the way um um this all right we're about halfway there um all right glass removal is successful i'm gonna add a little bit of solution here just to soften anything that may be still adhered to the panel and i'm just going to gently remove this glass and there we have it look at that good old gorilla glass so our next step is going to be of course we're going to want to give this a nice clean we're going to use our little rotary tool and then we're going to use our magic eraser sponge to remove all this glue let me go grab those tools and then we'll be right back so since the phone is still nice and warm i'm going to begin cleaning we're going to use our little rotary tool here which of course if you guys need these visit us visit our shop misterfoamdoctor.com we got it all all right let's go ahead and remove i'm going to go in and start with all the excess get all the large excess once i have that out i'll go through and give it a nice deep detail clean with our 9666 all right so majority of it's clean we got all the excess glue off next i can go ahead and begin using our solution and our magic eraser here so i'm gonna go ahead and just add a little amount here to the middle and work my way from the in out you guys can see how wonderful this solution and sponge works and of course with these since we do have to do these out of frame i'm gonna have to go ahead and skin this old lid from the mid frame chassis so that's just one other step that we got to do it doesn't take long you just want to be very very gentle when you're doing it there so now it's nice and clean look at that so next i'm gonna go ahead and just cut this off and to do so i'm just gonna use this oca that we have here and i'm gonna go ahead and just get in on here and just start cutting the glue and everything so i know the flex runs right up on here on this left area so i'm gonna need to be very careful not to go too deep and hit the flex uh so it's all the filling game here you know you just want to feel make sure that you're not forcing this through uh i think we're ready for the reveal guys let's go ahead and uh somebody want to put my gloves on for this process since i'm going to be handling this frame it's very very hot there we go good you always want to pull down because you don't want this flex to hit this chassis and there we go that is the separation of the oled from the mid-frame chassis and that took me 15 minutes so just for those of you guys out there trying to gauge your time that is my time so about 15 20 to cut the glass another 10 to clean and another 15 to remove the oled so all in all it's about an hour for that first process then next we can go ahead and begin laminating since this is already clean there is nothing to clean all the glue stayed on the chassis here as you can see so we're good but of course first things first we do need to test it make sure it's working so i'm gonna get my tester out and we'll give it a test and as you can see she has passed the touch test there we go there is the touch removed so the next step is we're going to go to the back lab we're going to go ahead and laminate our oca to glass and then once we have that autoclave we'll go ahead and laminate the glass to this oled panel so let's go ahead and step back in the back all right welcome back to the laminating room so in this next step i'm going to be laminating the oca onto the note 20 ultra glass you can see that here the two different parts we are going to be using our universal oca molds to laminate everything together and if you did not see my previous video on the oca and the magic mold i did make a video on those two showing you guys how they work and how convenient they are i'll leave a link up above so you guys can check that out of course first things first when we do begin applying the oca2 glass we want to make sure that everything is clean and we're going to use this base mold here and a little bit of iso 99 just to give it a little wipe down make sure there's no particles or debris floating around i'm gonna go ahead and set our glass on this mold firstly once we have our glass we're gonna use our little rubber grommets to adhere the oca onto it and as i mentioned in my other video this mold is just fantastic i just love the use of this it's universal you can use it on all model samsung series you don't have to worry about fumbling different metal molds like the old ymj molds that used to come out so um really really convenient if you guys are getting into this this is all you need you don't need to buy all these separate molds so we always want to make sure that the punch out on the camera lens is lined up properly so i am getting a nice overhead view just so we get a nice alignment last thing we want is our camera punch to be crooked once it laminates and a little hack if it is crooked you can also fill it in with a little bit of uh the liquid loca and curing it with the uv so if it's a little off you can just put a dab on it and just cure it with the uv light all right so this looks good looks nice and aligned we're going to put our top part of the mold on here which is going to grab the oca and i just like to give this a nice firm press make sure that's nice and even so you can see how we grab the oca right there beautifully and from here i'm just going to go ahead and just use my finger to run out any air bubbles run all these little guys out and we have a nice firm grab onto this rubber sticky mold all right so i'm going to go ahead and reveal the oca and then we can reveal that glass and we can set this on gently just like so open this up and we will go ahead and start this for this one's going to be running 100 seconds vacuum and the pressure is going to be a whole time of 150 seconds so for those of you guys out there and of course the temperature on the laminating heating plate is 70 degrees celsius so 70 degrees celsius 100 vacuum at 150 hold time we do this for all the glass this just makes sure that we don't have any kind of uh bubbling or curling on the edges so this is just something that we found out that works great and we're running with it so the laminating process has finished that's going to reveal make sure that everything is aligned properly and here we have her this one actually came out really really good i've noticed on these newer series for some reason there is no bubbling which is great you know even though this doesn't have any bubbles i'm still going to go ahead and want to put it in the autoclave for 13 minutes this just helps make sure that the ochre gets pressed up firmly against that glass and then we don't have any lifting in the future but let me show you guys this lamination here you can see how perfect she came out so let's go ahead and set this in our autoclave we'll go ahead and uh run this for 13 minutes and once this is finished we'll go ahead and come back and we'll laminate the oled onto it all right the first autoclave has finished let's go ahead and reveal the glass and everything looks perfect as good as it was it was when we put it in there so that's good so this is the magic mold that we're going to be using this is amazing it's a nice tacky spongy mold you can see and all these are available on sale on our website so um if you guys do need them visit www.mrphonedoctor uh there's a shop section on there you guys can find all these parts on there there that looks good so i'm gonna go ahead and just gently prop her up right here on her flex so that is safe there i'm gonna go ahead and reveal the oca and we'll go ahead and do the manual alignment here so we like to start from the top and just make sure that this punch is lining up perfectly once you get it lined up just want to slowly start aligning the oled down onto the glass it's got a pinch use like a pinching with your fingers just let it sit right in see that that's all you need you don't ever want to have any long presses or anything like that because what happens is the air once it sucks the vacuum out you'll get some large ugly bubbles so just one press is all you need now we can set this on our mold of course lining it up with the flex cut out good so we are good there we can go ahead and set this in and the settings we're going to be using is we're going to use a 0.3 pressure 70 degrees celsius the vacuum's 80 and the price time is only 7 seconds okay so this process goes very very quick good laminating has finished let's go ahead and reveal our oled and she looks very very awesome just want to gently lift there out of here and see here here's the oled press i mean everything's i mean there's very very few bubbles on here but the quality on this is is superb you know i mean you don't see any kind of flaws or anything like that with this old lid so we are going to want to go ahead and give it a test make sure that touch and display is responsive touch everything is perfect so i'm going to autoclave this for 13 minutes once again um once that's done we'll go ahead and cure in our uv light so let's go ahead and uh process this autoclave all right the autoclave has finished let's go ahead and reveal our note 20 ultra so there she is you can see all the bubbles have gone away everything is perfect and then of course the last step what we do is we put it in our uv light here this just runs for about three minutes and this just helps cure and harden the ochre as well so that'll be the last step on here to get this completed so other than that guys that's gonna wrap up our video i really hope you guys enjoyed everything got some useful information if you guys uh have any questions comments or need a screen repair let us know at www www.mrphonedoctor.com and don't forget to subscribe we'll see you guys in the next episode cheers

With this white background it makes it very very easy for you guys to spot any kind of bleeds or blemishes and things like that. to align the dot glass precisely right on the bezel i like to let it hit the bezels and once it hits i'm going to go ahead and drag it down that way i'm clear from any metal so we're going ahead and just set this in here get a little tight. course we're going to want to set this on our heating plate and temperature for all you guys asking it is 90 degrees celsius we like to use 90. let it heat up for us a good five minutes once it's hot we can begin the glass removal. i do recommend um let a professional handle this you know i make this look very very easy and it honestly is not. as soon as this gets up to temp all right the device is nice and toasty we can go in and begin removing i am going to want to go ahead and start from the two incision points that i left on top and to do that we are going to use our 9666 which works wonders. been eager to get my hands on some of these latest devices and we have finally done so so i'm gonna have some more videos coming out got the s21s lined up s21 pluses and those are gonna be pretty cool because there's actually several different methods of repairing those we could do those in frame and out of frame. us i mean sometimes removing the glass it could take up to 20 30 minutes that's just for the glass removal so for the most part it looks like we're good there we go two very clean openings right here. bit of solution here just to soften anything that may be still adhered to the panel and i'm just going to gently remove this glass and there we have it look at that good old gorilla glass so our next step is going to be of course we're going to want to give this a nice clean. ahead and just add a little amount here to the middle and work my way from the in out you guys can see how wonderful this solution and sponge works. Next i'm gonna go ahead and just cut this off and to do so i'm just gonna use this oca that we have here. process since i'm going to be handling this frame it's very very hot there we go good you always want to pull down because you don't want this flex to hit this chassis. The separation of the oled from the mid-frame chassis and that took me 15 minutes so just for those of you guys out there trying to gauge your time that is my time. that autoclave we'll go ahead and laminate the glass to this oled panel. Once we have our glass we're gonna use our little rubber grommets to adhere the oca onto it. i'll leave a link up above so you guys can check that out. and as i mentioned in my other video this mold is just fantastic i just love the use of this it's universal you can use it on all model samsung series you don't have to worry about fumbling different metal molds like the old ymj molds that used to come out. sure that's nice and even so you can see how we grab the oca right there beautifully and from here i'm just going to go ahead and just use my finger to run out any air bubbles run all these little guys out and we have a nice firm grab onto this rubber sticky mold all right. aligned properly and here we have her this one actually came out really really good i've noticed on these newer series for some reason there is no bubbling which is great you know even though this doesn't have any bubbles i'm still going to go ahead and want to put it in the autoclave for 13 minutes this just helps make sure that the ochre gets pressed up firmly against that glass. on our website so um if you guys do need them visit www.mrphonedoctor uh there's a shop section on there you guys can find all these parts on there there that looks good so i'm gonna go ahead and just gently prop her up right here on her flex so that is safe there. we're going to use a 0.3 pressure 70 degrees celsius the vacuum's 80 and the price time is only 7 seconds okay so this process goes very very quick good laminating has finished let's go ahead and reveal our oled. it in our uv light here this just runs for about three minutes and this just helps cure and harden the ochre as well so that'll be the last step on here to get this completed so other than that guys that's gonna wrap up our video i really hope you guys enjoyed everything got some useful information if you guys uh have any questions comments or need a screen repair let us know at www.mrphonedoctor.com and don't forget to subscribe.",

that you don't actually have to take the whole entire device apart you can simply remove the front layer of glass and once that's done you can laminate another layer right on top where the glass belongs so as always we want to test it and this is a verizon phone so I won't be able to get into the test menu for those of you wondering so I'm just gonna grab an icon on here and make sure to

make sure that it's working properly the last thing we want is to have to take this apart and clean anything that was not clean before laminating the glass ok everything's aligned properly we can go in and set this into the laminating machine it's gonna be about 4 to 5 minutes with this press alright laminating has finished so let's go ahead and take a look at the final lamination which

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 9 - How to Take Apart &amp; Replace LCD Glass Screen",
      "transcript": "hello there hope you're doing great today in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to take apart to replace the LCD and glass screen assembly on your Samsung Galaxy Note 9 alright so here we have it before we begin the take apart though let's go ahead and give this video a like it really helps us out a lot and also remember subscribe if you haven't already hit the bell for notifications on future videos and also a reminder we're gonna have links down below in the description where you can get all the parts and tools used for this repair so let's go ahead and get right into it here are some of the tools we're going to be using a small Phillips head screwdriver some open prying tools and a suction cup if you can't get any open prying tools you can also use a business card by folding it in half it will be much more sturdier so you can use it to pry up around the phone and you can also use playing cards as well so let's get started first thing we're gonna want to do is remove the sim and SD card tray next up let's go ahead and remove the stylus and get it out of the way and then the next step to begin the take apart is we're gonna need to heat up the back cover especially around the edges we can use a hairdryer or a heat gun I'll always continue to move it around never stay in the same place so that you don't burn the inside of the phone because the heat gun is very powerful so I just continue to move it around and heat it up for about a minute or two until it's too hot to touch it for more than like two seconds you can also use a hot plate which is what I prefer to use and I set it to about 110 degrees Celsius and leave it on there for about a minute or two as well so you may want to use some rubber gloves so that you don't burn your hands and once the phone is hot enough we're gonna go ahead and grab it with the glove and we're gonna be using a suction cup let's place it towards the bottom here where the charger port is and we're gonna give it upwards pressure here gently until we see a slight opening and the glass coming up from the frame as you can see it's already coming up so once you see that you can go ahead and place a prying tool in between and there we go so once we have it in there we can go ahead and remove the suction cup so we're gonna move the prying tool around the sides gently loosening up the adhesive and we're gonna go down one of the sides here we can use the help of another prying tool as well to keep the top open while we slide down the side with this prying tool so we're gonna gently go around the entire frame of the phone all of the sides to remove all of the adhesive holding the back cover on to the frame if the phone gets cools down we're gonna heat it up some more so that the adhesive can loosen up again and we're going to continue to go around all of these sides gently take your time especially if your back cover is not cracked because it can damage very easily here I'm using the help of the business card as well to keep the top open while we continue to go towards the top of the phone now be careful towards the top you don't want to stick the prank tools in too much because you can damage the fingerprint scanner cable you can also damage the wireless charging pad so that's why plastic prank tools are preferred so continue to go around the entire back glass until all the adhesive is removed and then once you see it loosening up you can grab it with your hands and wiggle it around and gently pull the rest of the adhesive off the small flex cable for the Pring your fingerprint scanner should disconnect by itself and as you can see there it is and next up we're gonna be removing 18 small Phillips head screws holding the back frame together you you once all of the small Phillips head screws are removed we can go ahead with the prank tool and pull up here on the charging pad and the plastic and it will come off fairly easily we can peel it off put that to the side let's go ahead and disconnect the battery to remove any electricity flowing through the phone and then we can go ahead and disconnect the bottom portion here where the loudspeaker is we can put that to the side so next up let's go ahead and disconnect the LCD and digitizer cable which is this one right here this is what connects the screen to the motherboard this cable here connects the stylus pad to the motherboard let's disconnect that as well let's disconnect the front selfie camera and the secondary front camera as well up at the top and let's go ahead and disconnect the charger port here at the bottom and pull the cable back a little bit then we're gonna have three small Phillips head screws holding down the motherboard to the frame of the phone so we're gonna remove those three screws once removed we can go ahead and pull up on the motherboard with the prying tool we can lift it up here at the top and gently leg wiggle it with your hands move the battery flex cable out of the way and any other flex cables and the motherboard will come out very easily as well and there we have the samsung galaxy note 9 motherboard so if what we're replacing is the LCD and glass screen assembly we're gonna do is we're gonna have to give it heat here once again now are now on the screen portion you can do that with the hairdryer heat gun or set it on the hot plate so give it heat for about a minute or two till it's hot enough then with the prying tool we're gonna wedge it in between the screen and the frame are on all sides and break off the old screen then we're gonna place the new screen in and place the cables in to do these slots right here gently position it and place it on there so let's go ahead and continue with the take apart next is the charger port at the bottom so we're gonna need to remove three small Phillips head screws two of them holding down the charging port and one of them holding down the headphone jack and with the prank tool we're gonna wedge under the charger port flex cable pull up on it gently and it comes off very easily so here we have the note 9 charger port next up let's go ahead and gently pull up on the headphone jack and it comes off pretty easy as well so let's go ahead and remove the battery with a solid prying tool we're gonna wedge on the bottom part of the battery and pull it up gently it is gonna have some adhesive so it is recommended to give it some heat first let's go ahead and remove the ear speaker with a screwdriver we can pull up on it gently here and the slight opening that it has on the side of it gently pull up on it and it will come off pretty easy as well just has a little bit of adhesive holding it on the vibrator motor at the bottom we're gonna do the same thing with the screwdriver push it in and pull up on it gently and it comes off very simple so here we have the proximity and sensor flex cable up here we're gonna with a plastic pry tool wedge under it I try and get under it without damaging the cable very carefully give it some pressure upwards and it will release as well pull that out and it's gonna have a little bit of tape here on the bottom and it comes right out so next up we're gonna be removing the volume and bixby button flex cable here we're gonna first loosen up the adhesive holding down the connector here so get under it with a prying tool pull it up just gently to get it another way and then with a more solid prying tool we're gonna need to give it some pressure on the metal portion of it and lift it up and it will come out and then you can pull it out with your fingers and there we have the volume and bixby button flex cable next up pretty similar is the volume button flex cable same thing with the plastic pry tool we're gonna wedge under it to release yet he said holding it down I'm gonna pull it up a little bit it's gonna have some more adhesive up here towards the where the stylus is that and we're gonna get under there with the plastic prying tool to release the adhesive and then pull it out once more very gently because the cable is very thin then with a screwdriver we're gonna give it some pressure upwards and it will be released and then you can pull it out with your fingers and there is the volume button flex cable for your note 9 alright so now that the phone is completely taken apart this is what the LCD a glass screen

      "summary": "In this video I'm gonna be showing you how to take apart to replace the LCD and glass screen assembly on your Samsung Galaxy Note 9. We're going to be using a small Phillips head screwdriver some open prying tools and a suction cup. You can also use a business card by folding it in half to make it more sturdier. let's go ahead and remove the stylus and get it out of the way and then the next step to begin the take apart is we're gonna need to heat up the back cover especially around the edges. I'll always continue to move it around never stay in the same place so that you don't burn the inside of the phone because the heat gun is very powerful. glass coming up from the frame as you can see it's already coming up so once you see that you can go ahead and place a prying tool in between and there we go. We're gonna gently go around the entire frame of the phone to remove all of the adhesive holding the back cover on to the frame if the phone gets cools down we're gonna heat it up some more so that the adhesive can loosen up again. now be careful towards the top you don't want to stick the prank tools in too much because you can damage the fingerprint scanner cable you can also damage the wireless charging pad so that's why plastic prank tools are preferred. Next up we're gonna be removing 18 small Phillips head screws holding the back frame together. disconnect the bottom portion here where the loudspeaker is we can put that to the side so next up let's go ahead and disconnect the LCD and digitizer cable which is this one right here. Let's disconnect the front selfie camera and the secondary front camera as well up at the top. what we're replacing is the LCD and glass screen assembly. We're gonna have to give it heat here once again now are now on the screen portion you can do that with the hairdryer heat gun or set it on the hot plate. headphone jack and it comes off pretty easy as well so let's go ahead and remove the battery with a solid prying tool we're gonna wedge on the bottom part of the battery and pull it up gently. we're gonna be removing the volume and bixby button flex cable here we're gonna first loosen up the adhesive holding down the connector here. We're gonna give it some pressure upwards and it will be released and then you can pull it out with your fingers. This is your Samsung Galaxy Note 9 completely taken apart once you're ready all you have to do is go ahead and place everything back together in reverse order. If you want to replace your screen you can also order this entire piece which will come just like this with the frame and everything it will be much easier to put back together but it does cost more. sides so that the adhesive can glue back on to the frame of the phone so go around all of the sides giving it pressure so there we have it that is how you take apart and replace the LCD and glass screen assembly on your samsung galaxy note 9.",

      "transcript": "since there were no videos on how to take the Droid Bionic apart on YouTube I decided to do this video I bought this one broken and I'm not actually going to repair it I'm actually going to sell it because something else is wrong with it um but anyway this is how you take apart if you want to replace the screen or the LCD first you're going to take the back cover off take your battery out pull straight out pretty simple now you got screws all around the outside edge pretty straightforward I got a a kit I bought on eBay it's better quality than the dinky little screwdrivers they give you with the screen repair kits this is really nice it's about $7 it's well worth the price and uh you you take your screws out all the way around and it helps if you have a magnet to put your screws on to but I can set them in here so I won't lose them just wherever you want to uh keep them so you won't lose them cuz you're going to need them put it back together some reason with this particular model and I fixed quite a few phones they don't all want to come all the way out of the plastic right here some of them do some of them don't it really does not matter as long as they're out of the the frame the Little Piece Will Come Undone so they don't they don't come out they just kind of sit there and they won't even shake out it's kind of weird don't know what's holding them in there it's pretty quick job though take this phone part I was pleased to see how easy actually came apart seeing how there were no videos on YouTube on how to take it apart I kind of just had to take it AP on my own and not uh have any help which sometimes that can lead to bad results cuz you can rip cables and stuff like that if you don't know where they're at basically don't pry on anything too hard it doesn't come start looking for screws or something else that could be blocking it all right now these PR tools you get you're going to need one of them probably I mean you could you could use your fingernail possibly but you get right the edge go all around the phone you hear stuff popping that's fine that's just two plastic clips that are right in there as you can see it's starting to come upward up top here be careful cuz there's a power button right there just kind of pry around a little bit and you can get next power button but do not pry right there you can Prim the out the corner it's kind of best to come along from the sides and get to come up starting to be a pain I think it's little screw that that left in here didn't get all the way screwed out I don't know they they ain't want to come all the way out there it goes now this particular model I didn't notice till after I took it apart cuz the LCD came like right out of the screen when I pulled the the back cover off and most of these phones they're screws below this plastic and with this one here uh not so much these are the only screws holding it together so it's this little label here you need to get your hair dryer and heat it up hot and then put your hand on the green board right there your hand right there and slowly pull upward and that little little plastic label here is going to come up if you don't if you don't do this you can rip the digitizer cable which is right here this whole thing will come shooting out and it did it with me and I'm just lucky me it's a broken phone I would have been more careful if it wouldn't have been broken but I went pulling hard in the first place I was being careful but you can never really be too careful with these things especially if you've never taken them apart before I've already done this label so it's it's coming off easier the second time but you can want to heat up the hair dryer and slowly just pry up you can hear stickiness giv away there it goes all right now you got the cover off so there's your board see I don't know what that is right there it's it's black it's like fried I think somebody took this SP apart before me and they done something to it cuz the phone won't come on and this the thing here had scratch marks on to it which is your LCD cable so that's no good but in order to take it apart you're going to want to Simply pry underneath this thing here and you want to pry that one off and then there's one right there too you pry both them off and this whole board will just pop right out of there as you can see I ain't got to take it take them off you can see the the board and your your LCD will just simply come out there you can pry along the edge real carefully to get the LCD apart just be careful your cables right here as you these things rip extremely extremely easy that's pretty much how you take apart and fix the Droid Bionic really simple I was really pleased with it not too difficult like some phones and if you have to like if you want to replace the glass you're going to need to get a haird dryer and Heat this thing up till basically you can't even hang on to it it needs to be hot and then you can just use your fingers from the back side like this just demonstrating you push around around the edges it helps if you do around the the outside edge on each side and get them free and then you can start the top and then you can just pry back a little bit and the bottom will come free too but it's pretty simple stuff so that's how you fix the Droid Bionic",

      "title": "Jelly Bean Unbrick, Restore, &amp; Update tool for the Motorola Droid Bionic",
      "transcript": "alright guys today I've got a video here on my Motorola Droid Bionic and this is going to be how to S be F or F X Z restore your phone with fastboot and a program called RSD light so this is going to do two things for you one it's going to restore your operating system to stock jellybean official OTA or two you can actually use this to update yourself to stock jellybean official OTA if you update will update or restore either way you're going to wipe your phone completely and you'll be running only stock applications you wipe all your data off everything it won't wipe your SD card or your internal sd card I don't think but I know it won't wipe the external for sure it might wipe your internal not really sure on that one but it'll put you back to stock so this right now is what I've got running on here I've got a couple applications Angry Birds let's go ahead and go into our settings just to show you guys that we are on right here Android version for 1.2 and it is system version 98.7 2.22 dot xt 875 horizon en-us so that is what i'm running right here like I said if you are on Ice Cream Sandwich and you want to update to jelly bean this will work for you and will update you to jelly bean so let's go ahead and go to my computer and show you guys what you need to do this so first thing you guys are going to want to do is get your motorola drivers which are these two files don't worry all files will be linked in the video description and down below so this is the motorola drivers for a 32-bit Windows operating system or a 64-bit Windows operating system you can guys can see what you need based on your computer by going to your computer and about about computer it should be in there so you can find that out and stick it figure out which version you need I think if you install the wrong one it will tell you it's the wrong one and you need the other one not really a big deal so these are the two files and then the lesson you're going to need is this program right here which is called RSD light now this right here that I'm showing you is 5.6 but you're actually going to want to run this version which is version 6.1 point 4 or newer is what you're gonna look be looking for so this is the program first thing you're gonna want to do is find well let me show you guys the SBF file this is the FBS FBS file or fxz file right here jelly bean and this is what it looks like it is an XML dot XML file again so I'll be in the video description to download so for what we're gonna do is we're gonna go hit the three dots right here we're gonna look search for that file so lines under my stuff Bionic and ethics FX file yours might be under downloads or something like that but you gotta know where it's at and find it someone click on it best thing to do is save it to the desktop then you're gonna click on the file you want and then say decompress only so why this is decompressing let's go ahead and show you guys how to hook up the phone alright very important install the motor law drivers to do this watch my Motorola driver install video linked in the video description make sure you follow all the steps in it to make sure these drivers are installed correctly so at this point we need to get into a pee fast boot to do that we're just gonna power off the device all right so if you're having a problem with your your device something's not working won't power up pull the battery and get it to the powered off state put the battery back in and then I'll show you what you do you're gonna hold down your volume up and down buttons at the same time see if I can do this hold them both and then hold your power button and this gets you into bootloader mode so now you're gonna scroll down to AP fastboot and then scroll up scroll up is the Select feature key key feature here make sure your battery is a hundred percent charged before you start flashing your phone if this fails because your battery is too low in the middle you're gonna end up with a bricked phone not a good thing you're gonna need a factory cable to get you out of that situation so from here we're gonna go ahead and hook up our USB cable which should be plugged in most of time I prefer plugging it into a back cable on my back USB port on my computer so that just connected and actually it's installing drivers on my computer let me see if I can bring this up and show it to you guys right here obviously I haven't installed the drivers for it in fastboot mode yet I have installed it in the other modes like my video will show let me get this zoomed in for you sorry so there it goes it shows me my ADB interface is ready to go so I'm gonna hit OK now or here on the program you can see that that file ID decompressed pop populates right here it's listed up here in the top file name populates right here and says Targa Targa is the code name for the Bionic so just so you guys know that and then it has this stuff listed right here which I like to expand a little bit so that you can see it says connected USB port and then it says under model it tells you fast-food CDMA Targa and bunch more if you keep expanding it so if you click on this it also populates this information which all says na but that's not a big deal so from here we're in our fastboot mode right here and we've got everything there it's all ready so then all we have to do is hit start and it's got 24 things it's going to do here it's on - it's on three all right so we're flashing pre-install it's gone through about 19 steps so far we're gonna come back to when it finishes up we're flashing here webtop vendor this whole entire flash process right now is probably gonna run you anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes just be real patient on it it went through system and a bunch of other things and it's wrapping up it did wipe user data look at that it did wipe user data on the phone so your apps will all be restored back to factory stock but it looks like it I don't think it wiped the internal SD card I know it doesn't wipe the external SD card so let's just let this thing finish up everything should reboot fine on the phone and we'll go from there it's performing the last step which was flashing radios and now it is rebooting the device you can see it's rebooting right here it's gonna reboot and I think it's gonna flash the radios in stock recovery so let's see if that happens on the back there it says we still are in Prague in progress so just be patient on it so here we rebooted into Android recovery to flesh right there you're flashing your radios that's what that is all about right there so just be patient it should boot out of stock recovery and finish booting up looks like the radio's are just about done just take a little bit on this screen like I said whole process of flashing this thing's a good 15 minutes at least just kind of nerve-racking you thinking Oh first time I've ever done this I'm afraid I'm gonna mess it up but yours is going like this you should be good to go just make sure you don't unplug this USB cable all right we just rebooted here out of Android recovery automatically and it's gonna go through the full reboot so just be patient on it sure everything should work normally here should see this stack Bionic boot animation and again first boot up on these devices could take up to 10 minutes technically on this first boot up so be real patient with it if it boot loops on you and just keeps booting back to the Motorola logo and boot animation not including the system may have to go into stock recovery into a factory reset in there wipe cache and data but should everything should work up fine so just let it boot there is the blue animation right there and it actually tried to open up a window here on the my computer because it installed the drivers again so Ord I'd say just let this thing boot up everything looks like grant fine so far I'll show it to you when it's booted up and we'll wrap this up alright just want to show you this really quick first thing you guys are going to get is this right here preparing device this is a good sign once you get to this point you know this process probably good to go there you go and this is your startup stuff so that is excellent thing I'm gonna go ahead and skim right through this and we'll get back to it all right so the device has fully powered up now you can see that it is back to stack I'm gonna go ahead and unplug the computer says still in process but you let it sit there long enough it will actually go to finished I'm not gonna worry about it right now you can shut the program down back here behind me if you want it is done at this point everything booted up just to show you really quick we go back to settings here and we'll show you guys what we're running here which should be that jelly bean what I was on before which it is Android 4.2 1.2 so there you go that is it guys that is the restore for the Droid Bionic or update to jelly bean so I hope you guys liked it that's it please follow me root junkie right here above my thumb this is my website got lots of great information on there you can follow me on Facebook or Twitter and we'll catch you guys next time thanks for watching",

      "title": "Motorola DROID 3 Revisit / Random Reboot Fix",
      "transcript": "I know we haven't been getting a long long head off I don't think that time hello everybody curious corduroy here and today I actually have a follow-up video it's the last review I did which was the Droid 3 since the video came out and now there have been some problems with the Droid 3 uh software and the phone itself so I figured I would do an update video Just to let you guys know uh some of the problems that I was experiencing and a lot of other people were experiencing and how I sort of fixed them for now now one of the biggest problems was probably the fact that people were experiencing a lot of headaches with Moto blur and uh the time I did the review I was not experiencing any problems with Moto blur it was running just fine it wasn't acting up uh it was pretty fast fluid and responsive but over time Moto blur became much more unreliable my phone would actually freeze lock up swiping back and forth I would have to swipe multiple times just to get to the next frame and my phone would actually shut down and restart itself much like my Droid X did when I got the new gingerbread update so one of the ways that I actually fixed that was I downloaded a new launcher now the launcher that I downloaded was called Go Launcher and uh there's another one also called Launcher Pro I've used Launcher Pro a while ago on my first Droid X and uh I liked it it was fast and it was fluid but I recently just discovered Go Launcher and I have to say it's one of the best launchers that I've ever used as you guys can see it's pretty fast it's fluid it's responsive it's reliable locking the phone is actually not a headache anymore I just swipe to the right and it actually gets it I don't have to swipe multiple times if there's an app that I need to access I just go straight to it and it loads it up right away it's it's reliable it really is it's probably what Moto blur should have been and uh there's a lot of really cool themes for it as well there is uh you know there's one that makes it look like you're uh running iPhone software uh the one I have now I believe it's called like classic black or something like that you can always change the wallpaper of course you can always download new themes there's a lot of free ones there's a lot that you can pay for but personally I'm really really enjoying Go Launcher you can go on the Android Marketplace and actually test this out for yourself if you're having issues with Moto blur you can always download Go Launcher or if you want you can check out Launcher Pro which is another solid launcher but I have to say Go Launcher is probably my favorite I guess you could say it's a permanent fix as long as you keep that launcher installed but let's be honest when you get a phone like this you expect the software to work correctly and uh Moto blur not working like it should it's a shame it really is when you get this kind of phone for this kind of price uh this kind of smartphone and this brand you expect much better and you shouldn't be experiencing problems with your software in the first place now there are rumors floating around that there is a new update that's supposed to be coming out uh but only the test Droid 3 phones uh have received the update as of now and uh I guess sooner or later they're going to roll out the update for all of us consumers out there so we can download it and hopefully it'll fix any problems but uh now that I have gold launcher I may actually not go back to moto blur just because I like it a lot it's fast it's customizable it's fluid it's simple it looks nice there's a lot to choose from from the themes and I probably won't go back to moto blur anyway but since I downloaded uh Go Launcher the phone's been running a lot better also another thing that made the phone act up is possibly your SD card if you're like me and you took an SD card from a previous phone a Micro SD card and you installed it in here uh there may have been files on that card as well as applications on that card that weren't jelling correctly with the new foam some applications aren't gingerbread ready uh thus making the phone act up uh in my case my phone was actually shutting down and restarting itself which I know a lot of people were experiencing as well so what I did to fix any problems I actually took my SD card and I formatted it and I also did a factory reset on the phone now uh that's not fun doing a factory reset uh especially when Google acts up and it doesn't back up all of your contacts so what I had to do was just a precaution I wrote down all of my friends phone numbers and I actually had to manually upload them back into the phone which sucked but uh I actually got the phone to work again so if you're having that problem that I was having where the phone just randomly shuts down and restarts itself and you're using an SD card from a previous phone I recommend that you well first of all if you have any important data on that SD card you should back it up to your computer right away then you're going to want to go ahead and go into your phone and go to your privacy settings and you're going to want to do a factory resets now when you do a factory reset there will be an option for you to I I guess I should just show you guys how this is done rather than just explaining it okay just got put my glasses on get edicated up in here I don't wear my glasses because I feel like I look better with my glasses off I don't know what do you guys think do do I look better with my glasses on or do I look better with them off I'm too sexy for my shirt too sexy for my shirt so sexyt okay anyway I can see again I may look a little blurry but that's because I enhanced the quality so that way the phone will show up much better one thing I forgot to do in my actual last review so sorry if you watched that review and the phone was a little blurry so anyway you're just going to start up the phone uh in this case since I'm using Go Launcher it's a little bit easier to access where I need to go so I'm just going to hit my uh menu button right here and go to settings so you're going to do is you open that up and you're going to scroll down and you're going to go to privacy select privacy and you'll see factory data reset uh in there I'm not going to actually go to it just for fear of the fact that I may reset my phone again uh so basically what you're going to do is you're going to go in there select the factory data reset and it's going to give you an option to format the internal storage of your phone and roll it back to factory settings and it's also going to give you an option to format your SD card now after you've backed up all of your information I recommend that you keep both of those checked uh cuz you're going to want to format the internal memory and you're going to want to format the SD memory as well once you do that you should be good to go and you shouldn't be having any more problems I've reformatted my card and my phone a couple days ago to factory settings it's been about 2 days and since then I haven't experienced any problems with the phone it hasn't shut down and restart itself uh the battery life is much better and it's well thanks in part to The Goal Launcher it's much more responsive now well that's how I solved all of my problems now I know it's a hassle uh to factory reset your phone and format your your memory card uh but that's how you got to fix this kind of problem and it's a shame really because when you get this phone you shouldn't have to worry about it messing up or acting up and you shouldn't have to go through the hassle of formatting your memory card and doing a factory reset it's not really fair to the consumers but hopefully they can uh iron out the bugs quick and and figure it out so if you guys are actually having any problems I hope this video helped uh if there's any questions that I did not address if you're experiencing any other problems drop by and leave me a comment I'll check it out and I'll try to help you guys as much as I possibly can because I know it can be frustrating when you get a new piece of uh technology like this you expect it to work when you get it and you don't expect any problems but stuff like this can be buggy especially first gen Tech and first versions of these kind of phones I'm I'm just like you guys I've been having problems if you need any help drop by and leave a comment if you like the video like it if you want to subscribe subscribe I'm not going to force you to but I'm curious corduroy and I will talk to you guys later I love you and why city of light City of Dreams city of sirens city of Kings you can feel the light flow through these streets this is where the great on stom they feet from the boogie down on over the Uptown stting I'll be back down what's happening they stop baby stay packing and why how I hate to leave",

      "transcript": "hey what's up YouTube see you back back to uh disassemble a Verizon iPhone 4. you can see that the screen is shattered and we'll be replacing the screen on this phone uh with a OEM version that I purchased off of eBay you can actually get them for pretty cheap like 25 bucks not a bad deal if you have a shattered iPhone uh there's a few tools that you're gonna need to complete this to the first being a a star wrench or tip a screwdriver a small Phillips screwdriver and either a really flat tip Phillips or a flat screwdriver I also like to use a dental pick deprive some of the smaller wires and connectors in an actual plastic price tool as well and it's good to help pry up and then the highest decimal opening tool since this uh screen is glued down we can use it to help pry it off let's go ahead and get started on this disassembly we're going to undo the two screws at the bottom housing or connecting the back cover to the iPhone we'll go ahead and start that left and right of the charging port is where they are located there's one down just one more to go to release this back cover for us all right second screw is out we're going to push up towards the camera on the back cover it'll slide up and you can go ahead and pull it off and that'll reveal the inner workings of the iPhone 4. now the first thing that we want to do is go ahead and remove the battery to do that we will need to undo this screw right here go ahead and take that out now what you want to do to prep this up is to use a pry tool this pull tab that is inserted on these phones is really weak and I don't suggest using it usually just rip it right off use a pry tool underneath it kind of pull it up we'll undo the connector here real quick connecting the battery to the iPhone whenever you're undoing these connectors be very gentle feel a little firm but nice and even pressure it'll pop right up the battery is glued down so you want to kind of work your pry tool around on the battery push in once you kind of get the battery started to lift up a little bit you can use the pull tab to help pull it out and give it some nice snug pushes there and it will pop right out for you make sure you do not puncture the battery so you make sure that you're using something that's nice and flat and not pointed all right the next thing we're going to do is remove the shield housing the top portion of the logic board I didn't do five screws these five that are connected just right here minus the one that's from the brass don't undo that one just yet now these screws are different sizes four will be smaller and the one that's connected to in the right in this particular picture is a little bit larger so as you disassemble the iPhone make sure that you keep track of where these screws go a lot of them are not the same and they will not go back in in universally all right now that we have all five screws out so we're going to go ahead and use our pry tool to pry up this shield and be nice and gentle there's kind of a hook portion uh at the top where it connects to the kind of the base logic board once you get it free you can pull it out we're going to undo the camera next so we'll just flip this little connector up and it does have a longer portion that hangs underneath the ribbon cable so pull it out to the right of the phone there the next we're going to do undo is The Shield that connects this ribbon cable there are two Phillips screws here we'll go ahead and do both of those both screws are out go ahead and remove the cover I'm gonna go ahead and pry this up using our plastic pry tool again be nice and gentle this does have a lot of adhesive on it sometimes it'll be stick uh sticking down to the the border so make sure you pry it up nice and slow the next thing we're going to undo is this is a little brass connected here with a small Phillips screw that hides an antenna we're going to go ahead and unscrew this take the screw out and take the brass connector off make sure you understand where all these brass connectors go they will need to go back in the exact same spot there are three on this phone and they are not the same I could use a dental pick right here to get into this nice tight space and Fry this Wi-Fi antenna up make sure that you are very gentle these candy form easily we're going to undo the ground and connector here at the top which is one of the other brass connectors he's a gentle pick to get in here as well this does have a portion that slides down grounding the phone so you want to make sure that you pull out the side that's pushed in deeper first you can see it right here we're going to start undoing some of the connectors here we're going to pry up this top one first it is glued I can do it so I get a better access to one of the screws to take the screen off undo this connector here which is part of the screen undo both of these two connectors and then you can release the LCD connections one's a little bit stiffer than the other there are three connectors here we're going to remove now here at the top where the camera was kind of at there's a little black piece of tape which actually hides a screw if you pry back the tape a little bit and I like to use a pair of tweezers to help pry this tape up so I can reuse it this is your third brass connector that is underneath the screw this is the last screw that we're going to need to remove to take out the logic board minus the three standoff screws we'll have to undo here in just a second all right that's kind of a grounding clip for the camera so make sure you understand how it came out as well the grounding points do fit right back into the logic Port logic board there one last screw at the bottom I'm sorry that I missed right next to the vibrator component there we're going to undo these three screws next now they do require either a flat blade screwdriver or a very flat tipped Phillips I'm going to use a flat blade here I'm going to unscrew these three screws now the two bottom ones the one that I just took out and the next one are actually shorter than the one that's at the top so you need to make sure again when you're taking these screws out you understand what part of the film they came from as there are a lot of different size screws in your iPhone this last one right here at the top will be the last screw we need to take out before we can remove the logic board there is one last connector here that I missed we're going to go ahead and pry that up and now our logic board should be nice and free be gentle as you're removing it from the ribbon cables and go ahead and set it aside next thing we're going to undo is two Phillips screws down here at the bottom to take out the speaker assembly this one that I've taken out right now actually has a little black piece of plastic attached to it so make sure that that comes off with your screw now the speaker Port does have about four prongs that kind of grounded to the the mid frame so when you pull this out make sure that you remove it uh pulling kind of pulling back towards the bottom of the forearm and then pulling up on the edge all right we made a big dent in this disassembly the next thing that we are going to take a look at are the screws we need to remove the LCD there are four small screws in each corner and three along the sides so the three longest sides and four screws in the corners the four screws in the corners are smaller than the the three that connected or the six that connect it to the sides I like to undo the corner screws first so I can keep track of where they go there is a small piece of a tape that covers up this top screw up here make sure you don't miss it when you try to move the screen out I don't like to pull the piece of tape out completely I just like to use a pair of tweezers to kind of pull it down so I can get access to it and then I can put it back up the way it was to kind of keep the camera from touching that screw are these are all Phillips screws let's use your fall small small tip Phillips screwdriver to go ahead and pull these four screws out so I do the four corners first to make sure that I can keep track of the screws this one can be a little bit tricky if you have a thicker screwdriver like myself I like to kind of leave this one for last so we'll give it just another second we'll do these remaining two down here and this here is our third Corner screw now make sure you don't strip this one out if you're using a bigger screwdriver if you're using one of the smaller ones that came with the kit normally it's not too big of a deal uh to kind of get in there you get a better angle at it there we go the next thing that we're going to do is remove the six screws the three on this side that hold the LCD in now all of these screws do have a washer that comes with it so make sure that you have six screws and six washers as you remove this phone you can see that there's a very small washer and the screw make sure that you do not lose those washers or else your screen will not tighten down very well all right here's our second screw on this side and there is a vibrator the vibrating portion of the phone if you pry up near the screw Mount to give a nice leverage it is pretty well taped down to the foam so just get a nice pry tool under there give it a nice even amount of force to pull it up and then we'll take out our third screw on this side of the phone three more to go and here is our last LCD screw now that that is out washer got stuck to the adhesive down there now that this all these screws are out so we're going to go ahead and pry the LCD away from the mid frame of the phone I could use an isessimo tool you can just use a plastic product tool this this tool makes it a little bit easier you can get nice leverage in from the side of the phone here and slide your tool down and you can stick it a little bit further in right here to start pulling up some of the glue this is where a lot of the glue is at on this phone make sure you're very careful of your home button exposing to the left of it there's a ribbon cable here that you do not want to damage or you have to replace your home button as well after you make a round you can see that it's starting to pry up for us to pry it out a little bit and then we'll work on the top portion start from the middle and work our way in make sure when you're putting your pry tool in that you're always putting it towards the top of the glass and not into the mid frame of the phone that way you can pry it off as well as not damage any of the internal components or Ribbon cables of the LCD if you plan to reuse that now as you're prying this away there's a kind of a fatter connector portion to this thicker ribbon cable you want to make sure that goes through the slot of the mid foam and that'll make your disassembly of the LCD come off a little bit easier all right pry that away last little bit of glue ribbon cable is ounce and we are down to the nitty gritty of this phone to replace the LCD now I don't have to disassemble this phone completely as the person that I'm working on only needs the LCD fixed that's how far we're going to take it we do make sure that you remove all of the excess pieces here if you want to see the reassembly video make sure you click the link at the bottom of the

Disassembles the phone using a star wrench, tip a screwdriver and dental pick. are located there's one down just one more to go to release this back cover for us all right second screw is out we're going to push up towards the camera on the back cover it'll slide up and you can go ahead and pull it off. That'll reveal the inner workings of the iPhone 4. bit you can use the pull tab to help pull it out and give it some nice snug pushes there and it will pop right out for you. Make sure you do not puncture the battery so you make sure that you're using something that's nice and flat and not pointed all right the next thing we're going to do is remove the shield housing the top portion of the logic board. the base logic board once you get it free you can pull it out we're going to undo the camera next so we'll just flip this little connector up and it does have a longer portion that hangs underneath the ribbon cable. are three on this phone and they are not the same I could use a dental pick right here to get into this nice tight space and Fry this Wi-Fi antenna up make sure that you are very gentle these candy form easily. piece of tape which actually hides a screw if you pry back the tape a little bit and I like to use a pair of tweezers to help pry this tape up so I can reuse it this is your third brass connector that is underneath the screw this is the last screw that we're going to need to remove to take out the logic board minus the three standoff screws. when you're taking these screws out you understand what part of the film they came from as there are a lot of different size screws in your iPhone. Next thing we're going to undo is two Phillips screws down here at the bottom to take out the speaker assembly. disassembly the next thing that we are going to take a look at are the screws we need to remove the LCD there are four small screws in each corner and three along the sides so the three longest sides and four screws in the corners. can be a little bit tricky if you have a thicker screwdriver like myself I like to kind of leave this one for last so we'll give it just another second we'll do these remaining two down here. give a nice leverage it is pretty well taped down to the foam so just get a nice pry tool under there give it a nice even amount of force to pull it up and then we'll take out our third screw on this side of the phone. Make sure when you're putting your pry tool in that you're always putting it towards the top of the glass and not into the mid frame of the phone. If you plan to reuse that now as you're prying this away there's a kind of a fatter connector portion to this thicker ribbon cable. to see the reassembly video make sure you click the link at the bottom of the screen here and that'll take you to the re assembly video.",

      "title": "iPhone 4 Verizon LCD Glass Digitizer Assembly Replacement CDMA A1349",
      "transcript": "hey YouTube but we're back for the assembly of this iPhone 4 that I disassembled the LCD from I have my new one here I'm table because he's got the new red plastic and some adhesive tape I'm gonna reapply to the iPhone you can see this nice and not shattered like the last one that we were using go ahead and peel off the backing of this LCD screen get it nice and shiny here we're gonna go ahead and put the adhesive on you'll see a lot of people not use new adhesive when you put an LCD back on these iPhones on a lot of videos that you watch but I really prefer to do so as I think it makes the phone a little bit stiffer and to be honest with you I spend a lot of time taking this phone apart and putting the LCD back on I don't want make sure that it's done right I also want to make sure you line up all the holes the top here make sure you're not covering up the front facing camera so make sure that the cutouts are lined up and you're not covering up anything that's really important you can move the adhesive around a little bit once it's on it's got a blitz kind of almost like a gel a little bit more rubber adhesive so you can kind of push it and apply it in the places that you want it to be and take it exactly where it should be on the phone now it is a little too big you can always cut to fit with maybe an exacto knife as well something that I do on a lot of Samsung phones is cut-to-fit 3m tape but this phone came with some pre-cut stuff it works pretty well on this bottom portion here make sure you're not covering up these two front sensors and the home button ribbon cable extends across which is the longer cut out on this little piece of adhesive here make sure you're not covering that up as you're putting this on make sure you you actually follow the cutout portions push it down a little bit and make sure that it's on there nice and well before I start trying to pry it off I like to use a pair of tweezers to help me pull this up make sure to rip it down on the edge of you're pulling up so you get a nice even lift off you want to make sure that the phone portion here is nice and level before you apply the adhesive as well if you have any old residue when you first remove the LCD make sure you scrape off all the old adhesive that way you seat the new LCD screen nice and flush when we're reinstalling it that we don't run into any hiccups as we go try to find an edge here that's put down nice and well that I can pull the sticker up with all right so we got an adhesive on here and we're going to go ahead and put our LCD on this flex cable the top you want to make sure you kind of bend it just a little bit that way it goes into the slot at the top of the phone easier so these two LCD ribbons need to go through this slot right here at the top make sure they pull all the way through before you push the top of the phone and the LCD together you don't want to bend this ribbon cable it is a little bit stiffer does have like a kind of a chip on the top of the cable so make sure you pull it through and kind of use that to help you pull the phone together now down here at the bottom the home button usually gives me a little bit of trouble so you have a nice slim tool maybe a pin I'll just use my opening tool to push the home button back into place shake it a little bit and you can almost hear the LCD kind of click on and when you've done that you know that it's time to go ahead and flip it over and get it set always check the home button before you start reassembly make sure that's press pressing you that everything feels good I try to get the phone else to be nice and level once you've done that we're gonna go ahead and reassemble the phone using the screws the first thing that we're going to do is put the four screws are starting the three screws at the bottom here that the washers to be honest with you I find this to be the hardest part of this entire thing is putting these on the easiest way for me is to put the washer on - they're kind of the raised screw port first use a pair of tweezers here to kind of push into place unfortunately it looks like my tweezers somehow got magnetized in my bag of tools or not be using that apparently once you get it nice and seated it'll kind of stay on it pretty well you can lay the phone down and seat the screw on to the top of the bit and make sure that you get a nice straight angle it'll add it and that will help you screw it back into place this is probably the most tedious portion I don't like to tighten the screws down completely yet what I want to do is get them all in first even the the four that go in the side and then what I do is push down and tighten the screws to make sure that my LCD is seated nice and flush to the phone put in our second screw here with the washer now you got to make sure that you use the washers if not you won't get a snug fit on the LCD on the sides and it kind of bow out and you'll see a gap in between the mid frame and the LCD so this is a pretty important part of your reinstall to make sure that looks professional and factory fit this is something that needs to be done sometimes they give you a little bit of trouble the important thing is here not to get really angry to keep your cool because this seems like only things get worse once you start getting a little stressed out another thing that I've done in the past to try to make them stick is I will kind of put a little bit I'll lick that the washer let's see if it'll stick to the phone if I get a little fresher that gives a little extra sticking power so I can get it into the screw port start on the other side all right telling you these washers are probably one of the most difficult things I'm an entire phone I don't know why they're so hard for me to do but telling you make sure you have patience for this portion almost done with these six side screws with washers alright I'll start putting in the corner screws here these are a little bit smaller than the side screws so make sure you don't get them confused these ones are a little easier a little more room to work with and no washers I always have a problem with the the top one that has all of the connectors bites so this is a tight space it's a little bit hard to get to this is the tricky one right here to be honest with you a slimmer screwdriver works a little bit better when you buy an LCD you usually get a lot of tools with it I think this one cost me there was like 25 bucks and it came with things like a guitar pick and a plastic polar and a few of the smaller screwdrivers with just a flat black sides now I don't really like to use those too much as I find it's a little bit easier to strip out the screws and get a lot of leverage so I do use this I fix it one that I have but in this particular case right here it's probably best to use something that's a little bit more narrow if you haven't removed the remaining connectors here and I'll actually switch to that screwdriver here just a few seconds to give myself a little bit easier time but I am stubborn I like to see if I can make it work a couple of expletives searching for that screwdriver here we go this is the screwdriver that I'm talking about you can get a little bit better angle I kind of got this screw slot here using this one then something's a little bit thicker man here we go all right now that you got them in they're still a little bit loose and we're gonna go through and tighten them all up I like to press down as I go through each screw and make sure that I get a lot of nice tight don't want to don't want to strip it out get it nice and snug it does have adhesive on the side so push down on the mid frame and the LCD are the kind of that bezel portion of the new phone we LCD we put in make sure there's no gaps or lines on the phone that really messes up a replacement and can damage your LCD all right let's go through each one and get them nice and snug here we go man I just not having luck one of my studio lights just one ounce oh there we go I paused it and replaced it here real quick so I don't remember what screw I was on let's go through and check these ones here real quick and make sure that I got him nice and snug all right there we go last one on the size of the LCD and we're going to do the ones here in the top once you get this screw in you can use a little bit thicker screwdriver to get a little more force and leverage so you don't strip it out when you're snugging it down push this one in and get it snug and then we'll check the LCD and the bezel to make sure that it's nice and flush you can see that there's no lines no gaps between our LCD and the mid-body of the phone you can go and start our reassembly of the phone now I want to start with putting in our vibrator module here make sure you line the top screw port up with the standoff on this mid phone that's it on very important parts if you made it putting the screw and then I realized oh hey my logic board is not in yet it's next thing we're going to do is put the speaker assembly in here - at the bottom now remember it has these kind of four connectors here that need to ground off to the bottom of the phone gonna get it perfect here so make sure you put them in and it slides into place all right now that that is done we're going to go ahead and put the two screws in this side that I'm putting in is just a regular screw and on the other side the screw has a little black corner triangle piece that I came with you can see right here in my hand it's got this little plastic on it so make sure you put it in flat side to the inside of the phone under the longer side of a triangle this one can be a little bit tricky sometimes all right we're going to go ahead and put the logic board in now just kind of have a little slot at the top he's a longer portion the top of the board we're going to slide it in and it'll kind of slide right into place pull these ribbon cables back make sure they're not caught underneath the logic board and one just slipped underneath again so pull these cables back this one a little bit you can push down to make sure your cable can get in there so slide your finger in get it nice and flat all right here we go make sure it's seated nicely into the interior here my cable came back out there we go does take a little bit of finagling and work and to get it right into the right spot you'll see that the screw all the screw ports will line up it will want to kind of slide up at the bottom portion because of the ribbon cable the first things we're going to do is put our little brass connector on at the top corner here this is the one for and actually we're gonna put the one at the bottom kind of corner in here the standoffs through the longer one that I took out at the beginning and we're using a flathead screwdriver to put this back in now for the two remaining stand-up screws that go down the side and what I mean by stand-up screw is really it's a screw that has another screw port on top of it and its purpose is it's to lift something off of the logic board so you can screw something into it but it won't touch what's underneath it that would be a standoff screw alright now don't let your speed of my videos up I don't want to skip anything that shows you guys that what can be a little bit tricky I don't like to make jobs seem easier than they are so I'm sorry this video is a little bit longer but I want to show you kind of the struggles of doing this make sure that you're comfortable doing it yourself putting the standoffs crew down here at the bottom and sometimes they're a little picky and they're a little bit easier to kind of start if you just put them in their slot apparently not these screws are easier to put back in if you have a really flat Phillips screwdriver I unfortunately do not I'm going to change my bit to a Phil spit just to see if we can get a little bit easier time putting it in just to get it started there we go now that I got a started we'll go ahead and snug it up with the flat tip laid all right now the logic board is nice and in and snug we want to put in this bottom screw down here by the vibration module put our antenna back on here it just slide into connector so make sure that you put it into its holder and then when you're pushing it on make sure that you use a gentle force oh you don't want to bend this if it doesn't snap on pretty easily that means that it's not seated correctly you need to move it around just a little bit more alright we're going to go ahead and put down some of these ribbon cables here get them out of the way so they stop popping up at least gonna be a little tricky as well you don't want to give them a lot of force as the connectors are very small so try to get it seated as possible and then put a gentle force with your fingers onto it and you'll feel it snap into place as well if it does not try to reseat it and then push down just a little bit harder all right so we're gonna put in this breast connector kind of the ground for the camera here at the top it has two prongs on it that will face outwards and would actually touch of the square camera portion and the top brass part where the screw part is is actually kind of a cutout on the logic board for how it fits in so it's not too hard to reinsert these do have specific screws as well for each one of these are a little bit smaller so make sure you're using the correct one here is our ground connector there is a ground port so you want to make sure you put it into the slots and it sits flush kind of push it at your finger or maybe some tweezers help got it into the right spot and we'll put our screw in for this one as well I forgot to put the connector down that this actually covers so make sure you put this kind of the antenna connector back on beforehand the point of this is is that it gets a contact above it it kind of covers it up a little bit we'll put our ground connector back in and do it right this time and we're going to put our last little brass connector down here that covers the antenna at the bottom near the vibration module all right to go ahead and seat the two LCD ribbon cables here now this first I'm putting down does get a little bit tricky as it is a little bit thicker you want to kind of bend it over and then push it back before you do that make sure you put the camera in well put this little caper back over of a screw that was here at the top I figure everything in this phone has this purpose so make sure you put it back in the way it is we're going to put our kiddin camera in and then we'll put our ribbon cable down you can see that the camera has kind of a an arm that comes off it that goes underneath the cables for the LCD that's why you want to put the camera in first just have a connector that you want to depress back on to it like I saying these can be tricky and I find that usually when I'm pushing them down it's because and they're not going it's because they're too far forward so what I usually do is to press it pull back put my finger on the front of it and then push it back just a little bit and it will connect back on like I saying make sure that you are gentle with these you do not want to damage these are all very important cables I put our round cable down that is a little bit sticky here at the middle so make sure you try to stick that tape back down we're almost finished with this phone we have a couple more things to do to put the shields back on and the battery back in so put our shield on for this one first it just has two Phillips screws that will hold this down here's our second just kind of checking those connectors make sure they're all nice and smug before I put the EMI shield on alright here we go now this is gonna be a little bit tricky it slides into the bottom here and it does have a kind of a little hook that goes kind of beneath a ribbon cable it runs with the side of the phone here the bigger screw goes on the outside so we'll put that one in first we have three more screws to go here all right excellent both of our shields Bracken's we just need to put back in our battery pull our a pull string up and make sure that you put the connector portion towards the bottom where needs to fit in and get that nice and snug and there is one last screw that goes into the back of this phone to hold the battery down alright let me go ahead and just power the phone on real quick and see there's our Apple logo so we can tell that the screen it looks like it's functioning here normally that's a good sign we'll go ahead and put our back panel back on make sure everything is in and snug and then put up come to the top slide it down to get it into place and then we'll put our two star screws that hold the back panel on for this phone one on the left and one on the right and then we are finished with this phone and our assembly is finished now you have a few other videos coming out so how to replace a power button on an iPhone 5 and a three-and-a-half millimeter jack on an iPhone 5 as well so if you like my videos if they find them helpful if you have questions feel free to put them in the comments or let me know go ahead and like the video subscribe to me if you want to see any upcoming as I plan on doing some tablets and maybe some loka options here as well and I can see that it's the screens back on we're gonna spy here make sure everything's functioning properly and it looks like it is perfect that's how

      "title": "Galaxy Nexus Screen Repair and Charging Port Fix",
      "transcript": "Alright, so today I’m going to show you\nhow to take apart the Galaxy Nexus. There are six screws all around the outside. I’ll speed this up. Also keep in mind this is the Galaxy Nexus,\nnot the Nexus, not the Nexus S, or the Nexus 4. This is the third Nexus, the Galaxy Nexus. Google’s gotten pretty creative with their\nnaming system. Anyway once those six screws are out just\ntake your pry tool and slide it around the outside of the screen and it will…there\nare a few different…there are a few snaps on either side of the phone as well as along\nthe top and bottom. And once those are out the screen lifts out\nof the back casing. Here you can see the three pins. There are also three water damage indicators. To take off the bottom part of the phone,\nthere’s only one screw and then the whole plastic piece just kind of snapped into place. So wiggle it a little bit and it will pop\nright out. It also has the little ribbon cable as well. One thing I really like about this phone,\nwith all the new Samsung phones they have the charging port as it’s own part of the\nphone and it’s not connected to the motherboard. The ribbon cable is…the first one is to\nthe charging port the second one is to the screen, and this is the third one. So right now I’m going to lift off the motherboard,\nyou can see on the side of the phone there is another cable that’s attached right here\nthat needs to be pulled off. And then those three ribbon cables and this\none wire cable are the only things holding the motherboard in place. Just kind of wiggle the motherboard out. The camera is stuck inside a little plastic\nslot so you just got to wiggle a little bit to pull it out. Right here the front facing camera can be\ndetached; you just flip up this little lever, you can pop the camera out, slid it back in\nand then clamp it back into place. So if you ever need to replace your camera\nthat’s how to do it. I’m going to show you how to remove the\ncharging port cuz usually that’s one of the main things that go out in cell phones. So there is sticky tape holding it down into\nplace and each one of those little segments has a little kind of guiding hole that help\nit fit onto the screen itself. And this is also held on with sticky tape. So just kind of pry it away. Then to put it back into place just make sure\nit hits each of those guiding holes so it sits right where it came from. I’ll try to post a link in the comments\nof where you can buy these just in case yours does go out. Those are the guiding holes. To put the motherboard back into place there\nis this little ribbon cable that attaches to the bottom of the motherboard so clip that\non first. Then you can fold the motherboard over, making\nsure to keep the ribbon cables on the outside. The top of the motherboard does need to slide\ninto place first; there are little plastic brackets along the top of the phone that hold\nthe motherboard into place. So right here I’m kind of wiggling it and\npressing it in underneath those brackets so that it will sit tight against the phone. There shouldn’t be any wiggling room. One more cool thing you can see right there\nunderneath my thumb, there’s the scan disk, like that’s where the memory is, the built\nin 32 gigabytes. I wonder if they’ll ever come out with a\n64 gigabyte where you can just swap it out. Looks pretty simple kind of like a permanent\nSD card. I’m just going to clip this wire cable back\nin place. All the ribbon cables and wire cables are\nkind of like Legos; you just put them into place, they only fit in one direction and\nyou just got to snap them in. And then this wire cable has guiding brackets\nalong the side as well that I’m going to push back into place. You can reattach the bottom plastic piece\nwith the correlating ribbon cable and snap that in. And then push the back into place as well,\nmaking sure to go around the outside of the phone and press all the little clips which\nattach the screen to the back housing. Then all that needs to be done is just slide\nthe screws back into place. And that’s it. Relatively simple. Samsung is usually pretty solid with their\ndesign. Anyway, if this helped you don’t forget\nto “like” the video and don’t forget to subscribe. I’m usually pretty quick with getting new\nphones showing you how to take them apart. Thanks for watching.",

      "title": "Nokia N8 Disassembly &amp; Assembly - Case Replacement",
      "transcript": "To disassemble and reassemble a Nokia N8,\nyou will need a T6 and a T5 Torx star type screwdriver. A small bladed screwdriver, pair of tweezers\nand a plastic knife. So first thing is to make sure its switched\noff, and we need to remove the bottom cover so take your T5 screwdriver and undo this\nscrew about 3 or 4 turns, no need to take it out yet. Thats about 3 or 4 turns. And just lift the bottom off. Now the bottom contains the GSM and 3G antenna. So if it’s damaged or broken you could find\na few reception problems. Now the battery bar, just lift up this corner\nhere and just lift it away. And get hold of the battery, and just pull\nthat out. Now go back to your T5 screwdriver again. And undo these 2 screws. Now they’re not very tight to undo, so when\nyou do them back up, just do them finger tight or otherwise your snap them off. Now come to the top of the phone, and open\nyour HDMI port you’ll find a small black screw there. So go back to your T5 screwdriver again. Just undo that screw. And it’s quite a bit smaller than the others\nso you can’t really get mixed up. Now a lot of people have been having trouble\npushing it off from the back, so I’ll show you an alternative method here. Take a piece of sticky tape and just apply\nit along the top, like that. Make sure this HDMI port is lifted out. Like so, so that little stem isn’t sticking\ninside. Then bring this over, so its sits on the top\nlike that. That gives you something to get hold of, and\nthen you can just pull the top up, and it comes off. Now we can undo these 2 screws, so back to\nyour T5 screwdriver again. And these are the last 2 screws holding the\nscreen on. And before we remove the screen, just want\nto take off this Wi-Fi antenna, if you just pop that up, and it comes off nice and easy. And turn it over, and just lift the screen\nup from the top. Now be careful here, this little rubber gasket\nsometimes falls off, it’s for the secondary camera, so just lift that out and put that\nsomewhere safe. And just open the screen up and we need to\nunplug these 2 cables, so just pop that one up, like so. And the same again here, just unplug that. And there’s your screen assembly. Now we’ve got 3 more screws to undo, these\nare slightly bigger, so use your T6 screwdriver to undo these 2 silver screws in the centre. And if the small metal clips fall out at this\nstage, don’t worry I’ll show you where they go when we put it back together. Then you’ve got a black self tapping screw\nat the top here. It’s quite a bit longer than the others\nso you can’t get it mixed up. Now we can lift the mainboard cover away from\nthe body, like so. And these small metal clips, they come off\nquite easy. Just put them somewhere safe. Now if you need to replace the earpiece you\nneed to use a sharp tool, and just insert it here, and then just prise the earpiece\nout. Just held on with double sided sticky tape. When you put it back in, you can’t put it\nin the wrong way because it’s got 2 small plastic lugs here, and they’re a slightly\ndifferent size each side. So it’ll only go back in with the small\nlugs on this side. And if you need to replace the charging socket,\nthat comes out like so. And then you can put your new one back in\nagain. So now we can lift the mainboard away from\nthe body, before we do that there’s a little rubber gasket here for the proximity sensor,\nsometimes that falls off so just get hold of that and put that somewhere safe, so you\ncan’t lose it. And that comes away. That’s your mainboard. Now we got the loudspeaker, I suggest you\nuse a plastic knife to lever this off because it’s got quite a strong magnet on there,\nand it will attached itself to your screw driver. Now be careful not to damage this surface\nbecause that can make your music a bit distorted. Now we’ve got the camera flash. So use your bladed screwdriver and just get\nyour screwdriver in there, and just lever that out, a small plastic clip just there\nthat locates in that slot. So once you’ve lifted that up you can take\nthat off. Now if you’re replacing these covers you\ncan just take them out, and they come out quite easy. So you can push it out from the back, and\nlift it out. Then we’ve got these little screws and nuts\nat the bottom here, these can be a bit fiddly. So take your T5 screwdriver and just hold\nthat nut and undo that screw, completely. And then the nut will just fall out, like\nso. The same here, undo that screw and the little\nnut just falls out. So now it’s time for reassembly, so take\none of these little nuts and hold it so it looks like that. Get hold of that little tab with your tweezers\nand just offer it up into the case like so. To keep it in place you want to take the screw\nand just screw it into that nut just a few turns just to hold it in place. There you go, so that’s that one done. Same again this side, get hold of your little\nnut and hold that part there and just offer it up into the case so it looks like that. And again get your screw and just do it up\na few turns just to hold it in while you put it back together, don’t do it fully up. Then we got the sim card cover, just put your\nsim card cover back in again and just making sure that little rubber lugs is sitting nicely,\nand then you’ve got your memory card, so put that in and just making sure that those\nlittle rubber tabs are sitting there. Now we can put the loudspeaker back in, it\ndoesn’t matter which way round you put it, so if you put it round this way, or this way\nit will work both ways. Push that into place, then you’ve got your\ncamera flash, this silver part is the capacitor just put that in first and then push that\ndown until it clicks into place. Now we’re ready to put the mainboard back\non again, so offer up the mainboard with the micro USB lined up at the top and don’t\npush it down just yet we need to line up this switch with the screen lock switch so at the\nmoment it’s not lined up. So if you line it up you can see that’s\nnow working ok. So before we put the next part on we need\nto put the proximity sensor gasket on, just get hold of that. And put it on that way round so the 2 little\nholes are at the bottom. And make sure your headphone socket is sitting\nin nicely which it is. Then take your mainboard cover and just offer\nthat up. Now we need to put those silver screws self\ntapping screws back into the centre holes. Using the larger T6 screwdriver. And now we got that slightly longer black\nself tapping screw in the top here. And then we got these small silver clips to\ngo in. I’ll try and get nice and close for this,\nyou need to hold it so the little hooks are facing towards you and then offer that up\ninto the little groove there, and push that down until it goes completely flush you can\nsee that’s completely flush now. The same with the other side, get the little\nhooks facing you and then offer it up into that groove and then push it down, you can\nuse a screwdriver if you want to. just push that down until it goes completely\nflush which it is. Now before we put the screen on we need to\nput that little rubber gasket back on the secondary camera, now it’s got a little\nflat corner and the flat corner goes towards the corner of the phone, so just drop that\nonto there, like so. And now take your screen plugs and offer them\nup and try and get it nice and straight and just push them into place if you get it lined\nup they go on quite easy it can be a bit fiddly so that one’s gone on and now we’ve got\nthe LCD screen plug here again just try and line it up as best you can and push it gently\ninto place you’ll feet it pop on there. Now we got to make sure this chipboard slides\nunderneath that ribbon cable which it has done and I’m just going to final check to\nmake sure that plugs pushed on which it is yep they’re both ok. So carefully bring the screen down making\nsure that rubber gaskets in place and then turn it over and put these 4 threaded screws\nin each corner and then back to your T5 screwdriver just do these screws up finger tight and then\nwhile we’re at the top here we’ll put the Wi-Fi antenna back on again so have the\nlittle gold contact towards this connector here and just push that into place like so. Then we want to put the top cover back on\nso just offer that up and make sure it’s nice and flush along the back there. And remove the sticky tape and make sure this\nmoves freely in and out if its trapped then just take the top cover off and make sure\nthis is pulled fully out when you put it back on then take that small black self tapping\nscrew and put it into the top hole here using your T5 screwdriver don’t do it up too tight\nor you’ll just strip it that’s fine then come to the bottom put the battery back in\nwith the gold connectors on this side, and your battery bar put the ‘T’ piece in\nthat little hole there put that back into place then take the bottom and just offer\nthat up and it should just go into place. Now you’ve got a bit of a space there at\nthe moment but if you take your T5 screwdriver hold that down and just do that up again hold\nthat down and that’s it, it’s all back together again so please give me the thumbs\nup any comments or suggestions do so below and I’ll try my best to make some more in\nthe future thanks for watching :)",

      "summary": "To disassemble and reassemble a Nokia N8, you will need a T6 and a T5 Torx star type screwdriver. A small bladed screwdriver, pair of tweezers and a plastic knife. smaller than the others so you can’t really get mixed up. Now we can undo these 2 screws, so back to your T5 screwdriver again. And these are the last 2 screws holding the screen on. Cables, so just pop that one up, like so. And the same again here, just unplug that. And there’s your screen assembly. Now we’ve got 3 more screws to undo, these are slightly bigger, so use your T6 screwdriver to undo these 2 silver screws in the centre. And if the small metal clips fall out at this stage, don't worry I’ll show you where they go when we put it back together. Small lugs on this side. And if you need to replace the charging socket, that comes out like so. And then you can put your new one back in again. easy. So you can push it out from the back, and lift it out. Then we’ve got these little screws and nuts at the bottom here, these can be a bit fiddly. So take your T5 screwdriver and just hold that nut and undo that screw. And then the nut will just fall out, like so. back in again and just making sure that little rubber lugs is sitting nicely, and then you’ve got your memory card, so put that in. Now we can put the loudspeaker back in, it doesn’t matter which way round you put it, it will work both ways. headphone socket is sitting in nicely which it is. Then take your mainboard cover and just offer that up. Now we need to put those silver screws self tapping screws back into the centre holes. And then we got these small silver clips to go in. phone, so just drop that onto there, like so. And now take your screen plugs and offer them up and try and get it nice and straight and just push them into place. So carefully bring the screen down making sure that rubber gaskets in place and then turn it over. cover back on so just offer that up and make sure it’s nice and flush along the back there.

      "transcript": "hey and welcome to part one of the long overdue nokia n8 restoration now i have been saying for many years that i will restore this phone at some point but it kept on getting pushed back in favor of other videos retro style review videos ringtones videos and so and so on but finally i have come to restore this phone that has been sitting in the corner for quite a while now about two and a half years well i can't say sitting in a corner because i've used this phone for multiple other videos actually yeah i have used this phone for a considerable amount of videos throughout the past few years that i've owned this thing uh especially comparing it to the n8 prototype and then the shutter video the nd filter video that i did the shorts video and multiple other videos so i have been neglecting this phone for quite a while but now it is high time we get to that restoration and this is part one of this restoration it's a bit long so i split it into two parts so let us start off by taking this thing apart and going from there so this is restoring this old nokia n8 here in 2022 so as usual before jumping right in don't forget to smash that like button down below as it helps this video get on youtube's algorithm and also don't forget to hit that subscribe button down below and ring that bell notification button so you're notified whenever i upload a new video also don't forget to leave a comment down below and let me know what you think about this restoration video or the nokia n8 do you own one do you own one at some point do you have one in your collection or anything else you want to let me know down in the comment section below also don't forget to leave a question if you do have one so we can i can answer your questions or we can start a discussion my social media is linked down in the description below which includes instagram discord and twitter and now let's jump right into this video now this video is broken into multiple segments so uh if you want to jump to the restoration part itself the disassembly part that as far as this video goes uh we'll be getting into all the other stuff in the second video but in this video we'll be disassembling it and somewhat prepping it for restoration part two is where i find the screws and stuff uh that need replacing and then we go from there so if you want to jump to that this video is segmented in the slider so the slider is segmented you can jump to whichever section you like but now i'll just give you some some background on this particular phone i bought it from i think it was romania or eastern europe somewhere in eastern europe romania latvia somewhere in eastern europe i i cannot really remember if i do find the ebay listing i'll put it up here but i don't think i'll find it because this was quite a quite a while back this was 20 2019 or some somewhere around 2019 i think so it's a really long time ago so i may or may not find the listing and i forgot how much it was probably it was like 23 or something like that and uh it came actually in a very bad packaging they barely patted back the bag was falling apart it was no it wasn't padded properly it was a reused bag held together by tape but this thing's screen survived the trip from what i believe is either latvia or romania somewhere in eastern europe all the way to the united states in a barely padded bag and the touchscreen as you can see wasn't cracked or anything like that it's in perfect condition relative to the way the thing was posted on ebay because when this thing was posted on ebay it was still in bad shape as you can see here the phone has been misused throughout its life the previous owner has jabbed it with a screwdriver this kind of damage does not easily happen he has tried to get into it before and sort of succeeded stripped all the screws in the process as you can see the screw is stripped i get i got rid of this screw a few years ago uh and i don't know where the screw is but still it was stripped and he managed to get inside and strip that screw as well but he got stuck there he couldn't get that screw out so i don't know why he tried to take this thing apart but as you can see there's no reason to because it works perfectly fine the cameras work everything works on this phone i've used it for multiple videos in the past comparing it to the n8 prototype this video especially uh where i compare this phone uh to the nokia n8 prototype which is completely almost completely different from the standard release model of the n8 if you haven't already seen that you can go watch that then i did the nd filter video quite recently the shorts video i've done a multiple set of videos on this phone in the past so this phone has been used for my videos but now it's high time that i restore it because it's in pretty bad shape and i'm still surprised that this thing survived uh from all the way from eastern europe in a bag that was barely padded but then again it's a nokia so you're not supposed to be that surprised these things are built like tanks but um again we're like i said in my previous videos we'll be restoring this not refurbishing restoring is using as much as the original parts as we can by reworking the parts refurbishing is a straight up replacing the parts which i'm not gonna do that's kind of pointless that is not a proper restoration when you get an old car for example a vintage ford mustang you don't start replacing the does chair seats and everything unless you have to you actually rework them that's why it's called a restoration and not a refurbishment so there are some things that we do have to replace on this phone as you can see here that some things are missing but apart from that we'll be actually refurbishing these phones we will also be giving this phone a brand new paint job i thought of going for a full black paint job so we will be spray painting this thing because of course there's a lot of scratches and stuff so we'll be sandpapering this thing down in part two and giving it a new paint job as well so definitely something interesting to see so yeah that was just a quick background on this phone so let us now get to it i'll start taking this thing apart and we'll go from there so the taking apart part as usual will be fast forwarded and we'll go from there free so what does perfect even mean is there with these expectations they keep weighing me down my heart is to see honey i'm a perfect created these expectations they keep weighing me down my heart is so there you have it this uh annoying probably the most annoying screw that i've ever had to work with and i've worked with a lot of screws um the screw that i've ever seen um to be this hard to take out now could i have brute force this thing yeah i could have got a drill and drilled the screw out but remember this thing is attached to the amoled so too much force and this thing is going to crack so i couldn't really brute post it i did try soldering it as you saw i tried super glue i tried cutting it with the xacto blade um i tried everything i tried bending it out of shape and that's what somewhat gave me some move some room to actually move this here and there because i could have swiveled it with the main ribbon over here there's a smaller ribbon under here that i uh covered at the last moment there let me take it okay there you go so that's the digitizer ribbon and that digitizer even was right next to where the screw the screw is so i couldn't really pivot it that way or this way because it was blocked by the piece of plastic so i had to undo the subframe as you saw by moving it slightly and i got rid of the subframe assembly here the as you can see here this is the subframe assembly got that out and using that itself i moved it out of the way and then since it moved i had more room i had to burn off some of the plastic as well with the soldering iron then i could use a plier to slowly undo the screw that was really really long and really really annoying so please leave a big thumbs up on this video and i know this is just part one of this video so definitely stay tuned for part two i'm not gonna do anything else with this phone uh as of today goes as as far as today goes uh i'm just gonna take a break uh upload this video chill out a bit and get back to it tomorrow that is all i'm ever gonna actually try with this phone this was the most annoying phone that i've ever opened period and i've opened htc m8 htc one m8s and stuff like that which were rated as some of the worst phones to repair but this one easily takes the cake because of the strip screw but yeah finally i got it open and i'm keeping this screw as a reminder of how pissed i was uh throughout this and i have to keep recording and as well i have to remember to record what what i'm doing don't want to make it too long either but of course it was fast forwarded for you guys while watching it now you saw the fast forwarded half but it took me a good close to 15 hours of messing with it to actually get it open because today all about now it's five o'clock in the evening and all morning today i've been messing with it while i was eating as well and last night to like three in the morning even after i stopped the camera i was messing with it without actually sleeping so yeah this was uh part one uh the uh horrible part one for me at least for you guys you're just watching from home and you're enjoying it but horrible part one of this nokia n8 restoration don't forget to smash that like button down below show some support also don't forget to hit that subscribe button down below ring that bell notification button so you're notified whenever i upload a new video in part two we'll prep it for spray painting and we'll start actually restoring this thing i was supposed to prep it a bit more but i'm tired and i got got the main thing away so uh we'll do all that in part two again leave a comment leave a question if you have one we can start discussion i can um i can answer questions and whatever my social media is linked down in the description below which includes instagram discord and twitter thumbs up and i'll see you guys in my next video",

      "title": "Nokia N8 step by step disassembly tutorial  #restoration",
      "transcript": "hello everyone and welcome today I'm going to do something about this box of Nokia as N8 because a subscriber asked me about some advices I'll be honest with you these days these past days I mean you can you saw that I didn't made didn't make too much videos because it's very stressful my job and I also have a second project to say like that on which I'm working on and I don't have the necessary time to make videos however I'm doing at least one a day yeah today is Sunday night my only real free time and uh yeah if I can't completely answer all your comments I see all your comments but I can't answer all of them because if I this is not my job I'm doing this as a hobby and if it's uh it's starting to sound like work and if it's becoming like work there's no more pleasure in it anymore that's why I'm making the video step by step and showing you step by step how to disassemble and reassemble the phone it's risky it's something that you must do at your own risk just like how I am doing it the same thing but hey it's the cheapest way if you do it yourself and it can also be the most expensive way if you're not paying attention and damaging something anyway here I have an N8 I don't even know if it works anymore I'm gonna try it the battery is dead dead I know it was one that tried at least to start it's not looking oh yeah they're all that oh the back of this one looks pretty good yes I'm gonna try to charge them and see which one of them works because I'm going to do one of them be right back so this is the only one that start that charged three bars I believe yeah the other ones are dead well let's start I mean it should start there we go give me the sound baby really no sound I don't know what that yep personal picture just like just what I don't like to see one second I'm gonna change it man these people and their personal pictures you know what I'm gonna do a hard reset on this and be right back yeah so well this phone is turned off I did some testing and it has a lock code which I cannot bypass well the lock code is not activated I can use the phone but if I want to change it I can't and I don't like the idea of having a lock code so I'm gonna do a tear down video of this step by step to show you how to disassemble it and then I'll try to do something about these other ones maybe one of them is not locked this one has a cracked touch screen rather than that it works so first thing you need is some torques foreign h let's start with the bottom part it has two side screws here and here you don't have to completely take these screws out just loosen it like so something like this and here as well it's already moved that should be enough and just pull this thing out if it doesn't want to come out lose a little bit more and there you have it so much just in this thing and this is the bottom part here is where the battery is pull it all like this well that flew to show you an idea of how it's supposed to be disassembled it it has like this hinge here you know when you one click it from here it should open like this and the battery wasn't changed it should have this plastic on it and which you can use to pull it out and there you go you've taken the battery out gonna put it here then let's go to the top open the HDMI port and here you have another small screw this one you have to take it completely out like so and now try not to use a flat do so do not use a flat screwdrivers use some sort of plastics like this press it on the sides and on the bottom part because this thing is very easy to bend and scratch it well this one it's a bit Cooperative but there are some phones that are not as easy to disassemble other n8s and now we have the top and the bottom removed see you have four screws here also before you take those screws apart take this thing this is like a clamp with a circuit on it now let's take these four screws out also here is where you have the phone's email oh this is tight oh good the screw snapped yep next oh boy this one as well Yep this one snapped as well on my phone I don't know why I think it may be corroded how about you Yep this one also snapped probably it was disassembled before and tightened too hard back anyway now you can take the touchscreen out see it's coming out now carefully pull it out because it has the connectors here it's a bit stick you know easily pull it out oh it disconnected it itself when I pulled it see the touchscreen and the display are glued together so this you have here this small connector and this other connector this little rubber thing came from the light sensor here if you wanted only to take the display and touch screen out congratulations you did it these things are glued between each other and they're very easy to crack you know I recommend using a heat blower or a well not a very strong one or a hair dryer but I'll use this hot air blower on the sides here oh it is glued all right I can try to pull it out from the bottom here it's a bit more space you have to be very careful not to crack the screen I heard something that I should not hurt not here okay it's coming out okay it's intact see there we go and all the glue remained here if you wouldn't use hot air it would have been a bit harder there's the display actually I'm going to take it from here so that it won't reflect on the camera and this is the touchscreen which we won't need because it's broken well this is how we disassemble that now let's go even further now we have here a bigger screw actually bigger torques take this thing out you don't want to check if there's any memory card then or SIM card nothing like this inside the good now they should just tear in half sorry split in half oh yeah there are also these two screws I've I was looking for them I knew there were supposed to be two more screws and I forgot their location here it is in the sides now it moves yeah sometimes these clamps fall off in case you these clamps follow from your phone and you don't know where they are they're from the sides here and here I can also take this one out of the way this one still holds too tight what the failed now something oh yeah the doors are well why am I not surprised that door is snapped this is just the metal plate plastic and metal plate where the charging port or the earpiece are located this is still good I mean you can reuse this and this is the main board you can just pull it out from this side up and slide it here it's uh it has this uh sponge like thing that isolates the loudspeaker and sometimes it gets ticked just pull a bit harder also when you put it back together make sure that you first put it on the left side and make sure that the unlock button lines up with the button on the main board like so it should be up see if I'm putting it here so you should enter in the buttons location here oh it moved there something like this see now with the it actually presses the button and that's kind of it this thing is not detachable this is well it it's in a clamp here but it's a solder to the main board so be careful with this and that's kind of it put this aside because I'm not going to use the main board since it has a lock code even though it works if the loudspeaker doesn't give you any trouble don't move it from here because it's easy to snap the membrane also with the Xenon flash this whole thing is the synonym Flash you can try to push it from here inside easy not with a screwdriver with your finger doesn't work you can try from here see it's easy to snap it well it's napping on mine because it's okay there we go here is where it has the clamps up and down snapped a bit here because if it snaps in air goes index Xenon won't work anymore because it will evaporate yeah so this is the Xenon Flash and this is the empty shell with the loudspeaker so this is how we did it apart I'll take this other two because they weren't charging one of them has something in the charging port and it's not going in correctly not much of a problem I am going to use that battery to check them well this one has a broken display not touch screen this one has nothing broken okay now it came off nicely let's put this you can start the phone with the bottom part disassembled it's almost oh never mind this one also has a correct touchscreen it vibrated they should start up okay it does that's good I'm gonna try to make all of them work in this video kind of weird to see okay for a second there I thought it might not be original but um phone management Security phone lock code one two three four five one two three four four okay good the lock code is good happy to see it unlocked this one is working quite nicely so we found a good phone to bring back from the dead somehow sorry now let's turn it off what I did not checked if it's uh locked in any network well if it's good then Vodafone is good enough for me because they mostly use Vodafone okay clicked in place let's try again hopefully it will work I hope it's not locked in any network well this one starts up I'm gonna disassemble the this one oh he was offline mode again nope oh so it works with Vodafone let's see the bars yep 3.5 G it works yeah we can turn this off one thing I want to show you on this opened body shell in case you let's say take the screw out completely like so this plastic falls off in case you find it in the phone this is how it looks you have to put this back I mean it even has a form factor like this you can put it the other way around it goes in like this see hold it in place here and put the screw back and now it's in its place well I'll get to disassemble this one and change take the display from that one and try to start it maybe this one also works fine if it does I'm happy I'm gonna make two working be right back I'm back again as a tip when if you want to take the top part off and it doesn't want to cooperate with this just pull it like this you know push it up like so just a bit not too much to snap it and shove this in here something like this see the clamps are on the side oh come it clicked back there we go now you know right so unfortunately there's this crew I found it like this uh I tried some methods to take it out and it doesn't work so I'm gonna have to use extreme measures try to cut it here because I'm also changing the touchscreen it's a bit idiotic what I'm doing but I don't have any choice and I'm trying to save the back shell that's a lot of glass kind of knew that was gonna happen anyway so yeah whatever this is kind of Taken forever okay come on your bloody master yeah this is a ugly but okay it should snap now yes this whole thing is going to trash so I'll just leave it here for now I still have to continue tearing this thing apart I'm trying to take the metal off the screw you know or snap the screw one out of two I'm gonna change this Frame there we go a lot of work but saved it this will go to the trash now do need to test it this is just for testing purposes now what the heck so much less than this thing well better than it started fast okay not bad did they put the SIM card in I did not put it great T-Mobile unless the phone it works there's something off here the touchscreen works good first thing I'm going to check is the lock code foreign okay it works how about the camera okay it works good right so I'll turn this off and no one cares you saw how to disassemble the phone I'm gonna disassemble these off camera and clean here and I'll be right back after I sort the parts and begin the assembly all right properly take these things up because sensitive you know there we go be right back yeah so we have a bit of a mess here uh right I'll start to assemble this starting with this one Oh but before I put this back uh which body shell is this one the less scratched or the more scratch they both have ups and downs yeah I'll just put um the doors snapped for the memory card on both phones it's a bit annoying and I'll have to use a white tap on one because uh yeah damaged where is that should I put the green one no oh yeah annoying at this organic rubber keeps snapping but what can you do nothing the camera has to be in the middle well the camera lens that is this is kind of how you put it back together stay here you filthy button okay you need these plastic screws well actually screws for plastic then the top one the black one then let's not forget these metal clamps all right good I do have to assemble the display with the touchscreen now so the screen got a bit dirty here and it was like we practiced okay before I put everything quite back the way it was I need to try it on you know a good one yeah sorry my phone overheated and turned up the record anyway the phone started oh beautiful it looks even though it's not yet assembled all right everything works great let me put this back in its place click it that was a weird sad click but okay I'm gonna put the top now they clicked nicely in place now for this no no no no no no no lock back lock back there we go I've taken the button from where is the button where button there it is I wanna get in there and this goes here and there's you can put this other way around see this little hole here goes in there okay anything else to put here no good okay button is pressing nicely now I'm pressing it hard and tighten the screws that's one oh easy now and that's well one phone is ready next easy not to snap it because I barely found it one good wait oh okay it had the external flashing I forgot something oh my God I'm such an idiot I forgot about it and this thing you need to put the small screw here on the top sorry I got a bit carried away it's almost 12 o'clock I mean midnight there we go don't forget about the top screw there we go it's a pretty easy phone to disassemble foreign this is when you hurry this is what happens you forget to do things for example putting this attempt to test it out yeah my camera turned off again but the phone started okay good different software I see okay uh everything works good to put it back together as well and I do have to take this off since you know I need to put the screw my God this is original yeah I don't have a black one okay I had that so it's gonna be a great stop it has gray hair deal with it okay the top is done I haven't took the disassembled this thing since it needed just a little cleaning that was it again pressing it tight these are just some excess parts from the other one so this one is done and this one is done hey I have two of them so now you know I told you step by step how to do it I hope you understand and be very very careful if you do this because uh I'm not responsible if you break your phone you know this is something you must do at your own risk like I am doing I've broken some phones but I'm happy I learned something on the way so thank you very much for watching if you enjoyed this and found it useful please don't forget to leave a like subscribe and

I don't like the idea of having a lock code so I'm gonna do a tear down video of this step by step to show you how to disassemble it. this and the battery wasn't changed it should have this plastic on it and which you can use to pull it out and there you go you've taken the battery out. Let's go to the top open the HDMI port and here you have another small screw this one you have to take it completely out like so. be corroded how about you Yep this one also snapped probably it was disassembled before and tightened too hard back anyway now you can take the touchscreen out see it's coming out now carefully pull it out because it has the connectors here. out okay it's intact see there we go and all the glue remained here if you wouldn't use hot air it would have been a bit harder there's the display actually I'm going to take it from here so that it won't reflect on the camera and this is the touchscreen which we won't need because it's broken. something oh yeah the doors are well why am I not surprised that door is snapped this is just the metal plate plastic and metal plate where the charging port or the earpiece are located this is still good I mean you can reuse this and this is the main board. since it has a lock code even though it works if the loudspeaker doesn't give you any trouble don't move it from here because it's easy to snap the membrane. If it snaps in air goes index Xenon won't work anymore because it will evaporate. The phone with the bottom part disassembled it's almost oh never mind this one also has a correct touchscreen it vibrated they should start up okay it does that's good I'm gonna try to make all of them work in this video kind of weird to see okay for a second there I thought it might not be original but um phone management Security phone lock code. to show you on this opened body shell in case you let's say take the screw out completely like so this plastic falls off in caseyou find it in the phone this is how it looks you have to put this back. have to use extreme measures try to cut it here because I'm also changing the touchscreen it's a bit idiotic what I'm doing but I don't have any choice and I'm trying to save the back shell that's a lot of glass kind of knew that was gonna happen anyway. foreign okay it works how about the cameraOkay it works good right so I'll turn this off and no one cares you saw how to disassemble the phone.

You can make it longer if you want to it won’t\nmake any difference. I made this from a plastic box, just cut a\nbit out. Once you've done that, take your camera and\njust insert this plastic down this side here, and you can see the cameras released one side,\nand then just insert it on this side and the cameras fully released now, and it just lifts\nout nice and easy, like so. All that’s holding it in are four small\nclips, there's one there and there and each side here, the centre one doesn't hold it\nin. And when you put it back together you can't\nget the camera the wrong way round as its got a small plastic lug sticking out which\ngoes into the groove on one side. So when you put it in, just offer it up. You can hear it’s clicked into place and\nthat’s ready to go back together. Please give the Thumbs UP!",

      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another video in today's video restoring my iphone 3gs 16-gig running iOS three point one point two you can see at the moment it's currently very scratched and beaten up both on the back and front of this phone now on the back this sort of looks like someone's sandpapered it on the front it's being dropped on its front quite severely and is quite damaged as you can see there also on the screen itself are a row of dead pixels up the top as well as down the bottom now this is a known sort of common issue with the first gen 3G and 3GS phones some just got dead pixels so we're gonna be fixing all this today so new housing a new screen and a new digitizer are all going onto this iPhone 3GS now iOS 3 was the first original release for the iPhone 3GS which is what this is running and this phone actually got for free I was sort of thrown in with two iPhone 4s as I bought on eBay and this just come along in the parcel as well so obviously they didn't want it they just thought I would have a better use for it so that's exactly what I'm doing here I'm going to be fixing it up to basically mint condition so this is my first time actually in an iPhone below the iPhone 4 because these ones aren't worth anything and they're not it's not like I'm fixing up to sell it or anything I'm fixing it up just because it's an old phone and I like fixing phones and you guys like watching my phone repair videos so this is for you guys because I've been asked continuously to fix this phone up so that's exactly what I'm doing so the 3GS is relatively easy to repair with most of the things you need to take apart are labeled like all the connectors have one two three four five in them so you can't really forget to unplug something and because it's an early iPhone it's pretty simple to work on compared to say the iPhone 7 or something which is a lot more involved I would say then the iPhone 3GS and 3GS the hardest part of this repair and I would say any iphone repair is the volume controls mute switch and power button assembly the power button on the 3GS is relatively easy to get installed and working but the volume controls and mute switch were quite difficult because I had to get the mute switch actually aligned properly with the actual switch inside the phone to the outside switch that you actually flick if they're not aligned it'll just move around but it won't actually change the mute so you have a broken mute switch and the volume controls they seem to be a little bit stiff and harder to press than they originally were but I think that's just because of the housing I got isn't exactly the most accurate of housings when it comes to lining up things because it was only 12 bucks from China so you can see here this is the new housing very clean compared to the old one but you have to transfer literally everything from the old one including the camera bracket the headphone jack little metal insert the speaker grilles which I didn't actually do because I couldn't get them out so I'll just have to purchase those elsewhere and get those installed at a later date the middle bezel all the power button volume controls dock connector vibrate motor everything you can think of and all the way down to the little SIM card eject a piece of plastic that that actually sits at the top of the phone that when you push the pin in it will actually eject the SIM card all that has to be transferred over so it's quite an involved job and this entire that process took me about an hour now like I said first time I've ever worked on anything below the iPhone 4 and it wasn't hard it just was time consuming and very fiddly because all iPhone screws are absolutely tiny because well we can't put big screws in a tiny device so overall wasn't hard just time-consuming and you know a problem with the 3GS and 3GS was the battery expanding so if you have one that has an expanding battery it's not hard to get the battery out all you to do is remove the two screws get the screen out and then there's about six screws and the logic board comes out with a few cables disconnected and you're right infront of the battery and you can remove and replace it with a new one if your 3GS has a bad battery that's expanding and cracking all the back or putting pressure on the logic board itself mine didn't have that issue which is great so there was no damaged to the old housing besides all the scuffing and scratching but I have seen a few with the battery expanding and causing giant cracks in the back of the phone so if you have giant cracks in the back of your 3G or 3GS that's definitely an expanded battery so I want to open that up and just relieve the pressure of the logic board or you could do some serious damage to the logic board itself and then render the phone useless itself now like I said really old phone and really the only reason I'm doing this is for you guys and plus I like to fix phones and it's just a hobby of mine I don't fix them I'm not I don't work at a repair shop or anything I just fixed phones purely because I find it fun and interesting so like I said this is an old piece of Apple history and I like to fix them up just to you know see exactly how they were built so connecting up the screen actually purchased on eBay nothing happened it was recognized in iTunes but the screen wouldn't line up but after connecting up the old one you can see here that the phone continued to boot up I actually had a heap of iPhone 3G and 3GS Parts I brought for about I think was like two dollars or something I've got a video on that if you're interested but basically I connected up one of those screens and the LCD worked but the digitizer itself was faulty so all I had to do was take that back off again and I'm gonna transfer that good LCD on to a new digitizer and home button assembly which is relatively easy to do on the 3G and 3GS with new iPhones the LCD and the digitizer are laminated together which reduces some tiny little gap in between the screen and probably makes the phone thinner itself but obviously before we go ahead and do that now that I know the phone is fully functional I've tested the volume controls the mute switch power bar and all that kind of stuff I can go ahead and screw the logic board in and then I'll get the screen and start working on that so with the screen itself there is four screws holding the LCD in itself so once you remove those four screws the LCD separates from the digitizer itself it can actually take the glass bit off of the plastic frame but because I have a load of these lying around I just grabbed another one and went ahead and screwed in the LCD after replacing the five screws two on each side and one at the top I was able to reinstall this new digitizer paired with an old LCD onto my 3GS now the cords are a little bit bent because they've been sitting in storage for quite some time and I went ahead and powered up the phone itself and you can see here that it powers on once I got the okay that it was powering on I took the plastic screen protector off there and put the phone back together now along with those 3GS Parts I got a load of 3G screen protectors so I'll also be putting a plastic screen protector on this phone to just protect the new digitizer the phone itself is in 100% mint condition the only scratching on would be on that metal band that we transferred from the old housing now compared to the old screen and housing you can see how much nicer this phone now looks it's no longer scratched and smashed so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you want to see more iPhone videos and iPhone restoration videos go ahead and check out the iPhone playlist down in the description if you're not already subscribed go

      "title": "How To Restore A 6.15.00 iPhone 3Gs/3G To Firmware 4.1 And Unlock!",
      "transcript": "hey guys everything Apple Pro here and I'm making this video due to the sheer amount of people that are messaging me constantly about how to restore their device that they've just tried using Red Snow 0.9.6 beta 5 basically to update your baseband 6.15.00 and they basically brick their devices they can't reboot it it gets stuck in either recovery mode or the Apple logo doesn't boot up I'm going to show you guys how to fix this I'm going to put my device into a brick state right now I'm going to use iTunes to Brick it try to restore it to the original firmware and when I'm back hopefully I'll have a solution guys and I will be able to show you how to fix your device guys before we get started I want to let you know that this is for any 3GS or 3G that has been breaked using Red Snow while you're trying to unlock it with the iPad 6.15.00 baseband and this will fix it no matter what condition it is whether it's not booting or whether it's in recovery mode and it works I'm on a Mac it works on a Windows and Mac so don't panic about that guys and on with the tutorial okay guys I am at my MacBook right now and I will be restoring it into the official firmware which will break it so I'm going to hold shift or option and restore and I'm going to select the official 4.2.1 firmware and if all goes well hopefully it'll break it for the purpose of this video guys so I'll be back soon so the restore is going good I guess if you can call it that but it's going good okay so I got that famous air 1015 in iTunes and I guess that's a good what's up guys I am back and I have great news I have successfully fixed my iPhone from errors such as recovery or bricked it just won't boot I have fixed it guys and I will show you guys right now it has kept the baseband so you can unlock basically what I've done is I've downgraded it through iTunes to 4.1 and after that I have jailbroken it with lime rain well not yet but I will in just a little bit and after that you can go right into Cydia and install Ultra snow which will unlock your device since it still has the 6.15.00 base band so guys it's really not that bad it is fixable just like that and I'm going to show you guys how right now so basically what you guys will need of course is iTunes 10.1 and your 4.1 version now it doesn't matter what condition your iPhone is in right now it doesn't matter if it's in recovery if it's in um if it just doesn't boot uh it's all fixable so what you want to do is open up your iTunes and whoops um so you'll open up your iTunes and make sure you have your firmware on your desktop and what we will be doing is putting our device into dfu mode so it will hold power and home for 10 9 8 7 6 and we'll let go of the home button just a second three two one so let go of the power button and keep pulling the home button and you'll just keep holding it until iTunes recognizes it and I do mean like over the power button sorry about that so my iTunes has kind of Frozen up in just a second it should recognize this all right so here we go so your iTunes has recognized your device it doesn't matter what condition it is as long as you have put it into dfu mode so remember um home and power for 10 seconds then let go of home I'm sorry power and keep holding the home button and I'll put a in-depth guide right there that'll help you with this but from here you'll hold shift on a Windows PC and option on your Mac and you'll select the 4.1 firmware not to be confused with the 4.2.1 and you will restore and this is stock firmware it will downgrade it successfully and after it's done I'll be right back okay so once your device finishes restoring I know yay it's finally done um for some of you maybe you have some trouble maybe you're restoring to a custom firmer make sure that you're restoring to the official 4.1 firmware by Apple and it will boot up but it will have an emergency screen that you'll have to slide to do emergency calls if you guys aren't legit if you're not using ATT then you will um you'll get that screen Don't Panic it's perfectly normal the jailbreak that you will do will solve this and basically we're done right here I'm just going to tell you what to do right now so now that you're on 4.1 firmware and you have the updated baseband you do not need to update to 4.2.1 um if you have that well of course you'll have it so all you have to do is jailbreak using lime right now I'll put a link it'll be up here it's the lime range jailbreak you'll do that and then you'll go into Cydia and install ultrasound it's as simple as that guys that was a really quick fix and I'm really sorry that it took this long but hopefully this will fix everyone's problems with their device being stuck in recovery mode now please give me a thumbs up guys I work pretty hard for this video and make sure to subscribe and leave a comment um just try and help other people if they're having trouble guys because I can't be there for everyone

home but i've never had a white iphone 3gs um and this white one does not have the crack at the back cause the white iphone 3gs was known for cracking at the back and getting discolored by the heat because the 3gs had an overheating issue this one's back looks decent but i may be wrong either way before we jump right in don't forget to smash that like button as usual and hit that subscribe button down below and ring that bell notification button to get notified whenever i upload a new video i'm on instagram discord and twitter and you can follow me on those using the links down in the description below and now let's jump right into this video so first let's take these boxes off the tops off the boxes and uh they're still with their wrapping there as you saw there um i noticed the uh the white one seemed a bit bloated and it kind of has raised off the back the battery may have expanded look let's look at the black one first uh see what else is inside this box uh this one has a crack as i remember yep but i do have a couple of iphone 3gss to begin with um but that's fine yeah the battery on the white one definitely has bloated look at that mark on the screen there let's see what's else in the box here we have nothing white one kind of feels a bit different let's uh take that later this has the rest of the box um let's see we have the uh the book full of uh stuff does it have the stickers let's see oh the sim card tool is also there uh the stickers there though i have millions of apple stickers at this point yep the stickers are still there and they are unused so this part part has not been used uh this thing is also still there so that's nicely sim card too um put that aside oh we have the accessories also on use is it's unused yeah the wrapping is still on there so uh accessories are unused this is also unused uh the old style as you can see the other rounded edge one instead of the squared edges one um the old style connector so let's put that away for now let's put the two boxes away and let's take a look at the phone and right out of the bat i can say there's something wrong with the 3gs the white one look uh it's not supposed to do that now look at the black one doesn't really roll that easily this one rolls quite easily ah it feels different too oh i don't know if you can see that i'll see the difference but that white one has completely bloated like the blast the battery must have expanded so much it's expanded the plastic that thing looks really fat look at it look at that thing damn boy and uh yeah that thing has uh definitely fattened up so let's uh that that we'll need to replace the battery there's no reusing the battery on that thing so let's get a charger going here see the black one if it charges or if it takes charge here um do not want to be using my good charger let me use my uh let me use my um where's my other charger the older one um let's use this one and uh see if it charges turn on the power let's see if it uh does anything the batteries could be shot at this age um oh so yeah this one definitely turns on and we'll have to reuse this things battery for that one um so the apple logo turned on there the battery probably needs some charge i'm gonna give it a bit of time and be right back okay so while that thing over there charges let's take a look at this and uh it's worse than i thought it has expanded quite a lot here and since it had nowhere to go it oh it has uh really messed this boat up the way i can see probably the entire body actually let me get a screwdriver here and let's take this thing apart okay so uh i partially got it open there i had to bring it really close to me because even the suction cup wasn't really doing the trick um so yeah the battery has definitely expanded then the shields have not helped either uh the black spot on the display went because it was forcing the display there um let us get these uh clips open now um don't have my nails through the gloves so use this um i usually use just my nails to un unclip things because uh i can feel it and i know i'm not gonna break anything using tools isn't the most ideal thing in some situation so uh display looks fine uh there's a screen protector over this display so i'm pretty sure it's a really fresh display underneath the old display there is a screen protector as you can see there yeah the battery is completely bloated um i'm just wondering it's put a lot of stress on the boat i hope it has not damaged the boat and oh there's an old atnt sim card in there let's get that out um pull it like that um oh yeah i uh collect these old sim cards so that's a nice addition to my collection um let's get this uh let's get this off before it breaks the uh boat even further i'm what i'm really worried has this already damaged the boat the boat is really warped as you can see there so yeah so uh we released the boat and the battery holy look at that um i hope the boat isn't damaged it is badly warped we're gonna have to uh heat this boat back into shape of look at that oh boy that thing is really fat um that is the fattest fact that i've ever seen fat um but yeah that does not look good that could explode any moment so i gotta be careful hold up i'm gonna have a closer look at this thing now comes the part which i do not like now i'm not gonna be shoving things underneath there because uh one wrong move and we're gonna have a big problem so i'm gonna use this tab like thing to pull this thing up and these tabs really didn't do much this thing unlike the galaxy note 8 battery doesn't want to budge the note 8 battery when it bloated it uh wanted to budge really easily this thing on the other hand does not seem to want to budge so yeah this thing doesn't move um come on come on oh to come yeah these tabs were never great you know what i'll do this off camera because i don't want to die after this thing uh probably explode so be right back so uh that was not budging so i put a bit of alcohol behind the battery onto the the glue and it loosened up the alcohol trick always works and we have the battery right here the glue is in a strip like thing i still gotta be very careful with this battery like look at this thing i've seen bloated batteries but there's no give on this usually there's a bit of give to show that there's a bit more air in there but this has no give whatsoever i am too scared to poke it even further um yeah i'll bring it closer so you can hear it you hear it it kind of vibrates i don't know if that's coming up on camera it kind of vibrates it's so tense the skin on this thing is so tense let me do that again you should actually feel it uh for the vibration damn this thing is at its max uh these skins do a real job in holding back uh house fires so yeah this and that samsung note 8 battery i still haven't disposed of that but this uh is uh definitely going in the recycle um i might have to actually take it to the county and tell them to recycle it separately because the weight of the recycling the electronics recycle alone will set this thing off so yeah i have to go uh dispose of that responsibly um the rest of the phone the bow does not look too good let's uh kind of put the glue back here we might need it we don't need too much of the glue but we need some of the glue and that is your old school type of pull tab there are really pull tabs they're just like pull up tabs the back of the phone went back to being flat so that's good this is actually in a really good condition the back of this phone there's barely any scratches as you can see there sadly uh the frame is cracked here because of the battery expanding the display looks good but the boat not looking too good there um let's get rid of the camera first um we're gonna heat treat the boat sort of we're gonna heat the boat and i'm gonna bend it back in shape sort of um let's get rid of the heat shields here and this brings back a lot of nostalgia honestly um i have a lot like i said i have a lot of iphone 3gs and 3gs i practiced repairing phones on iphone 3gs and 3gs because they're probably the easiest phone to take apart just the glass lift it the ribbons are dead center there even if you accidentally pull the display like that these two ribbons go first so you're gonna notice you're gonna notice that you messed up and these ribbons don't break easily there are lego styles so they just clip out and then only you have the slide out and that most of the time also just slides out so you technically can't break this while trying to repair i learned to repair phones on the iphone 3g and 3gs i had a lot of them back in the day and they're still at home uh thousands of miles away um sitting in my cupboard i uh missed those things so this thing brings back a lot of memories i remember removing all their batteries because those phones all worked i managed to fix most of them i remember remember removing all their batteries if i came to college and uh and all my other iphones and ipads as well because i knew i won't be seeing them for a long time so yeah this brings back a lot of memories i've also done another iphone 3gs video which was a failure this one over here that's a 3g as i remember was it a 3ds or a 3g i can't remember um let's get these shields off here um the metal is not moving um i usually do this with my fingers so the glove because these are ripped and you can cut yourself really badly on these so be careful when you're lifting these off um yeah i'll do this off camera hold up so i have the cover off here the metal covers and we can see the boat here and though there is an apple logo on that processor there that is a samsung as i remember s5 pc 100 i could be wrong but i remember it being the samsung s5 pc 100 which is a arm cortex based uh samsung design processor so at this time it would have been the arm cortex eight so samsung designed uh arm cortex uh eight based processor uh uh s5 pc 100 it's about 600 megahertz and it's a single core processor it's the last uh processor not designed by apple so after the iphone 3gs obviously with the iphone 4 uh the a4 apple designed that in-house but this thing was designed by samsung and was based on an arm processor so the boat is not looking too great as you can see it is bent quite badly i can feel the bend as well i don't know how the solder joints are holding up but i'm pretty sure this heating that will do and will will lightly bend this back in place um i'll lightly bend it and i've done this before with an iphone 3g boat with also uh with well that boat actually um something hit it and the force itself didn't break the boat uh but it damaged the boat it hit it from the back and i had to replace the body and stuff so i did remember i i did remember that and i managed to fix that phone and replace its body and bend the boat back to shape that was about 10 years ago so i'm doing the same exact thing uh here in 2000 2021 so yeah let's heat this thing up to about 200 degrees and we'll see what happens okay so um the boat is technically a bit better now um over time when you screw the thing down it will go back into shape uh over time um and um now i'm gonna just reheat it again just to try and refill the stuff i didn't take it to 200 degrees um now because i won't be able to touch it and if if i touch it stuff is going to start falling off because the solder turns the liquid so i it was about 120 degrees just enough to bend the boat back in shape and it was a bit hard to touch so i use these now i'm gonna heat this a bit more especially the processor and the toshiba uh memory module over here uh if you didn't see that already i don't think i showed you that was a toshiba memory module this is the 16 gigabyte model um the other one is also 16 gigs and um yeah so i'm gonna heat that up let it cool off and we'll be right back and while that thing cools down the other one has turned on and is actually in perfect working order the battery's taking charge it turned right up and uh yeah that one's good to go and that's good news because i don't have another uh 3gs battery lying around that works so let's get this thing charged at least to 50 percent and we'll take this apart and take its battery out now i'm going to do that off camera because that's just be me taking apart an identical phone but i'll get the battery out and we'll put it onto that board and see what happens so i might just put that board in here and we'll see what happens uh with the other display as well so let's do that after a bit all right so i've taken the other one apart as well and it is extremely dirty on the inside it has been clearly used uh much more than the other one and its battery is a bit puffy as well you'll hear the sound yep battery's a bit puffy but it's still usable it still takes a charge uh might leave it in there for a about a year or two more this could go down when the battery is fully charged uh this happens when it's basically a form of deoxidation or something i can't really remember exactly the process it's got to do with the electrolytes and stuff um this happens uh when the battery is basically flat for a long time and it's put away for storage so these phones may have had good batteries when the previous owner put them away for storage um but these uh the things ballooned over time because they were not charged now if i fully charge this there's a chance it'll go back to its original shape uh not entirely but it will but this one is not that bad anyway let's put the white phones boat in here and we will uh we will test it out with the screen from the white phone as well because i want to see if the screen has been damaged easy to put on lego connectors the battery has charged let's power it on ah maybe it needs the charger let's grab the charger hmm we're not getting anything i mean that boat was really badly bent so um hmm let me take a closer look and i'll just actually give it some time just let it warm up a bit be right back uh okay so i checked the boat again and i have to screw down those two screws there near the battery so that uh the uh the battery gets uh put in place properly and again this one also turns on as you see here the display looks fine and everything's good to go i guess uh this thing turned right up on so i had to actually tighten the screw near the battery so that the battery gets pushed up that the boat gets pushed up against the battery properly because there's no connector uh the the batteries are pads at the bottom there so let me show you with the other board the batteries connect to these pads here so no sim card installed there is a wallpaper unlock this is this thing jailbroken no it's not uh what version is this thing running the other one was running ios 6. um this thing is running ios 4 as you can see there um version 4.0 so this one's a bit older anyway i'm gonna take a look at this see if there's any previous user information i'm pretty sure there is look at the capacity i'm gonna erase all of those and be right back so uh there's nothing really in terms of photos and stuff uh that i had to erase just a bunch of stupid wallpapers and pictures of a cat or dog or two the most of the most of the storage has gone for music this thing is loaded with music and turns out the previous owner has very similar music tastes to me in terms of classic music like abba the scorpions uh van halen um so many older uh from the 70s 80s asia which i do listen to i really like the scorpions and abba van halen um i think there was uh def leppard there's there's a couple of older bands um that was the other band uh ac dc was in there and uh motley crue there we go motley crue was in there as well so a lot of older music which is great to see um the screen protector on there this is a really high quality screen protector it's that really nice feeling matte screen protector from back in the day so whoever used this phone really loved this phone and let's bring its back cover out as you can see it's not scratched so it definitely had a case on it um so yeah there's nothing really else that i can do i'm just going to clean these phones but clean these phones up and since this boat is running ios 4 i kind of want to mess with ios 4 a bit uh because it's been a long time since i've ever used ios 4. um i'm going to put the battery in the white phone and keep the black phone for later because ios 6 i have it on my ipod touch and stuff so yeah anyway i guess that's it for this video the two phones work there was no major repairs needed but it is what it is and as usual i hope you enjoyed this video and if you did please leave a big thumbs up on this video down below hit

      "transcript": "Welcome to the iPhone 3G Take Apart Guide To begin grab your phillips head screwdriver and remove the two phillips head screws at the bottom of the phone on either side of the dock connector. Now grab your nylon tool or flat head screwdriver and gently pry up between the metal part and the digitizer of the iPhone. It is suggested to use a nylon tool as it is a safer method when lifting up the glass in the iPhone. Once thats complete, gently lift up and there will be three connectors numbered 1, 2, and 3. Remove these in this order. Grab your nylon tool or phillips head screwdriver and gently lift up on cable one and two. Cable three has a lock bar and the cable slides into the connection on the Logic Board. Gently lift up the bar, and the connector should slide out. Making the LCD and digitizer mechanism, free to lift up and out. Now to remove the LCD from the digitizer, remove the three screws on this side of the LCD. And the two screws on this side. And there is also a screw in the top right hand corner of the LCD. Remove these. Once that is complete, now grab your flat head screwdriver or nylon tool and very gently lift up the LCD out of the digitizer mecanism. Now to remove the Logic Board, you will need to remove cables 4, 5, and 6 in this order. These are snap on cables, so you should very gently lift up and they will come undone from the Logic Board. Once that is complete, now there are seven screws that need to be removed from the Logic Board. And remove these. Now grab your nylon tool or flat head screwdriver, and using extreme caution lift up the Logic Board out of the bottom pan. The isight cable will be connected and is very easily snapped off the Logic Board. So gently remove that if it hasnt already come off. Now lift up and out to remove the Logic Board. The battery is held on only by double sided tape. So you can use your nylon tool or flat head screwdriver or the tab that they provided. You will need to apply some pressure.

      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another video and in this video we're gonna be doing a retro restoration on Apple's second ever iPhone the iPhone 3G this iPhone was sent in to me along with an iPad first generation 32 gig in mint condition from Aden he sent me an iPhone for us a while back massive thanks to Aden for sending this in he has an absolutely amazing iPhone collection is absolutely massive and he's going to be doing a collection video on that very soon so go ahead and check out his youtube channel link will be down below asta Palms now this here is an iPhone 3G now it's in very rough condition has big cracks along the back it has a cracked screen and scratches all over and in this video we're going to be completely restoring it with a new housing a new screen a new battery as well as a new document - which I'll go into why we need to do that a bit later but you can see here that there is massive cracks on the back and is missing bits of plastic all over so it looks like it's been abused throughout its life and today we're gonna be making this thing look brand new why no one's actually gonna be using this phone it's purely just for my collection and I just enjoy fixing up phones and even old ones like this I have the parts on hand so I might as well put them to use and fix up an old iPhone now this was the second iPhone Apple ever released so it is kind of cool to take a look back and repair one of these completely and give it a new housing a new life so we're also going to be downgrading this thing back to iOS 2.0 this isn't going to be an instructional video on how to do that although I do have a video that I can recommend to you guys to watch so we'll talk a little bit about that later but right now I went ahead and opened up the 3G and just attached a new screen to make sure that the screen really putting on this actually does work now the iPhone 3G and 3GS are really easy phones to work on when it comes to screen replacements if you crack your glass you can just take the LCD out of the glass frame and go ahead and buy another one and just slap it in and that's something that the 3G and 3GS absolutely great for screen replacements are easy and you know are very cheap to do whereas modern screens the glass is laminated to the LCD meaning you'd have to replace both of those at once and that's why they're sort of more offensive so the iPhone 3G and 3GS cheaper iPhones to repair even when they were current iPhones taking out the logic board here there's only a few screws holding all that in and you can see that is probably the thinnest thing in this phone the thing that makes the phone so fat is actually just where the battery is placed and that comes out quite easily next up we would take the vibrator out you can see there's a little bit loose in its housing but still does function and still works just fine next up we're gonna go ahead and take out the power button and volume controls and a mute switch assembly now this is by far the hardest part of any restoration on an iPhone is just getting these back in to the new housing and getting the mute switch to work is probably the hardest thing to do it is quite difficult because it may look like the switches are flicking and working you put it back together and then it doesn't work and you have to rip everything apart now I got lucky and it worked first try for me but sometimes it takes me a few guys to try to get it back up and running next up we're gonna go ahead and take out the dock connector and go ahead and transfer that later into our new housing next up the frame still won't lift up because you need to go ahead and remove that GPS antenna up from the top of the iPhone you can just use a metal spudger and that comes out no problem let me go ahead and remove the metal frame and now this actually would be what supports the structure of the iPhone 3G it's very strong and it's also quite heavy compared to what I was expecting it to be and when you're in the phone you also want to transfer over the little chrome pieces from the camera the headphone jack as well as the little grilles from the speaker and microphone this is our new housing you can see just how much cleaner the insides look of this housing now I had these laying around because I purchased a massive heap of iPhone 3G and 3GS parts and now I'm just putting them to use on some older iPhones that need fixing up you can see here this is how I lay out all of my parts whilst I'm doing an iPhone repair or restoration I lay the parts next to the screws so you can easily remember where the parts come from and put them back together when the time needs to be now I'm gonna go ahead and put the dock connector back in now this isn't the connected this is the original one but I'll talk a little bit about why I had to change that once I get everything put back into this phone but go ahead and start reassembling the things that came out of the old housing like the GPS antenna as well as this little bracket that goes underneath the SIM card tray there I think that helps to something with the sim tray ejecting so make sure you do transfer that over to your new housing next up go ahead and put the quorum little inserts in with the camera and go ahead and put the camera bracket back into the iPhone after making sure everything's are lined up we go ahead and install the power button and volume button assembly now I did skip this on the video because it was extremely difficult to do and get aligned and actually properly working but it may take a few times to get everything aligned up so just be patient with that that is the hardest part of this restoration next up we go ahead and put the vibrator in and attach its little bracket and screw that all down now adding all these parts in actually secures the frame the frame around the the metal frame around the device is actually just held in by other parts so it kind of just sits there and then everything else screws down into it next up we're going to put the battery back into the device and press that down making it stick nice and good and then go ahead and put the logic board back in and without screwing it down just so I can go ahead and test out all the functions the phone will working like that mute switch and volume controls power button things like that so once you go ahead and connect all that we go ahead and turn it on and test it out now the battery died on me and you can see that you can still see the icons on the display but the phone is off you can't tap on anything or anything like that so I charged it back up and it's working just fine yet again and then go ahead and test out the functions of the device like the mute switch and things like that once I can confirm they work I can go ahead and take the screen off and to begin work on the screen now the screen itself has some dust and residue inside the LCD and glass so we can go ahead and take the LCD out and just give that a clean with a microfiber cloth just to clean it up and get the dust and dirt out of the screen also do this on the actual frame digitized let me go ahead and put the screen back in and screw everything back down and now we should have no dirt or dust in between this screen and glass now we go ahead and reconnect the screen for the final time and go ahead and turn it on now at this point I realized that the home button was still not functioning even with a new screen assembly so it's time to open up the phone again and take a look at where the home button connects now the home button itself connects to the dock connector so the first point of trying to fix this was just to replace the dock connector so removing the logic board I also added a new battery which I had in stock so I thought I might as well put that in as the other one just randomly cut out on me before and now I could take the dock connector out and I actually had some of these laying around so what I went ahead and done it was literally just take the little boot piece off the little bit of rubber there go ahead and install it on the one I had in my parts bin go ahead and slap that in and reconnect everything and the home button was up and functioning so to test the home button after you have it connected just go ahead and open it up and just touch the little two contacts there which line up with the home button pins and you can see here if the home button is up and running once I went ahead and sealed everything back up again and reinstalled the screws it was time to get this thing from iOS 4.2.1 back to iOS 2.0 now this is just a time-lapse of what I did to downgrade the device if you want to step-by-step instructions go ahead and check out the iDevice archives video he does an amazing tutorial on how to downgrade back to iOS 2.0 this instructions are clear and it's what I use to downgrade my 3G pretty much all you go ahead and do is restore a custom firmware after you put the device into a special DFU mode and then once you do that you'll be on a jailbroken version of iOS 2.0 and then that will allow you to restore with iTunes again iOS 2.0 stock and then that will actually fail and you just use an application like reboot to kick it out of recovery and then you'll boot back into iOS 2.0 now like I said if you want to step-by-step instruction video go ahead and check out the iDevice archives video link will be down in the description you can see here it's all complete and it now says your iPhone has been unlocked and we're back on iOS 2.0 removing the plastic protective film from the back of the new housing will really show off just how shiny this iPhone now looks and this is it the iPhone 3G retro restoration and downgrade to iOS 2.0 this 3G is just in about as mint condition as it came out when it was pulled out of its box back in 2009 yet again I'd like to give a massive thanks to Aiden at asj Palms on YouTube and at Twitter for sending in this iPhone 3G and iPad first-generation which will be featured in an upcoming video and on that note this has been a huge F is video if you liked what you saw hit the subscribe button and consider

      "title": "IOS 3.1.2 iPhone 3GS Restoration",
      "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to another video in today's video restoring my iphone 3gs 16-gig running iOS three point one point two you can see at the moment it's currently very scratched and beaten up both on the back and front of this phone now on the back this sort of looks like someone's sandpapered it on the front it's being dropped on its front quite severely and is quite damaged as you can see there also on the screen itself are a row of dead pixels up the top as well as down the bottom now this is a known sort of common issue with the first gen 3G and 3GS phones some just got dead pixels so we're gonna be fixing all this today so new housing a new screen and a new digitizer are all going onto this iPhone 3GS now iOS 3 was the first original release for the iPhone 3GS which is what this is running and this phone actually got for free I was sort of thrown in with two iPhone 4s as I bought on eBay and this just come along in the parcel as well so obviously they didn't want it they just thought I would have a better use for it so that's exactly what I'm doing here I'm going to be fixing it up to basically mint condition so this is my first time actually in an iPhone below the iPhone 4 because these ones aren't worth anything and they're not it's not like I'm fixing up to sell it or anything I'm fixing it up just because it's an old phone and I like fixing phones and you guys like watching my phone repair videos so this is for you guys because I've been asked continuously to fix this phone up so that's exactly what I'm doing so the 3GS is relatively easy to repair with most of the things you need to take apart are labeled like all the connectors have one two three four five in them so you can't really forget to unplug something and because it's an early iPhone it's pretty simple to work on compared to say the iPhone 7 or something which is a lot more involved I would say then the iPhone 3GS and 3GS the hardest part of this repair and I would say any iphone repair is the volume controls mute switch and power button assembly the power button on the 3GS is relatively easy to get installed and working but the volume controls and mute switch were quite difficult because I had to get the mute switch actually aligned properly with the actual switch inside the phone to the outside switch that you actually flick if they're not aligned it'll just move around but it won't actually change the mute so you have a broken mute switch and the volume controls they seem to be a little bit stiff and harder to press than they originally were but I think that's just because of the housing I got isn't exactly the most accurate of housings when it comes to lining up things because it was only 12 bucks from China so you can see here this is the new housing very clean compared to the old one but you have to transfer literally everything from the old one including the camera bracket the headphone jack little metal insert the speaker grilles which I didn't actually do because I couldn't get them out so I'll just have to purchase those elsewhere and get those installed at a later date the middle bezel all the power button volume controls dock connector vibrate motor everything you can think of and all the way down to the little SIM card eject a piece of plastic that that actually sits at the top of the phone that when you push the pin in it will actually eject the SIM card all that has to be transferred over so it's quite an involved job and this entire that process took me about an hour now like I said first time I've ever worked on anything below the iPhone 4 and it wasn't hard it just was time consuming and very fiddly because all iPhone screws are absolutely tiny because well we can't put big screws in a tiny device so overall wasn't hard just time-consuming and you know a problem with the 3GS and 3GS was the battery expanding so if you have one that has an expanding battery it's not hard to get the battery out all you to do is remove the two screws get the screen out and then there's about six screws and the logic board comes out with a few cables disconnected and you're right infront of the battery and you can remove and replace it with a new one if your 3GS has a bad battery that's expanding and cracking all the back or putting pressure on the logic board itself mine didn't have that issue which is great so there was no damaged to the old housing besides all the scuffing and scratching but I have seen a few with the battery expanding and causing giant cracks in the back of the phone so if you have giant cracks in the back of your 3G or 3GS that's definitely an expanded battery so I want to open that up and just relieve the pressure of the logic board or you could do some serious damage to the logic board itself and then render the phone useless itself now like I said really old phone and really the only reason I'm doing this is for you guys and plus I like to fix phones and it's just a hobby of mine I don't fix them I'm not I don't work at a repair shop or anything I just fixed phones purely because I find it fun and interesting so like I said this is an old piece of Apple history and I like to fix them up just to you know see exactly how they were built so connecting up the screen actually purchased on eBay nothing happened it was recognized in iTunes but the screen wouldn't line up but after connecting up the old one you can see here that the phone continued to boot up I actually had a heap of iPhone 3G and 3GS Parts I brought for about I think was like two dollars or something I've got a video on that if you're interested but basically I connected up one of those screens and the LCD worked but the digitizer itself was faulty so all I had to do was take that back off again and I'm gonna transfer that good LCD on to a new digitizer and home button assembly which is relatively easy to do on the 3G and 3GS with new iPhones the LCD and the digitizer are laminated together which reduces some tiny little gap in between the screen and probably makes the phone thinner itself but obviously before we go ahead and do that now that I know the phone is fully functional I've tested the volume controls the mute switch power bar and all that kind of stuff I can go ahead and screw the logic board in and then I'll get the screen and start working on that so with the screen itself there is four screws holding the LCD in itself so once you remove those four screws the LCD separates from the digitizer itself it can actually take the glass bit off of the plastic frame but because I have a load of these lying around I just grabbed another one and went ahead and screwed in the LCD after replacing the five screws two on each side and one at the top I was able to reinstall this new digitizer paired with an old LCD onto my 3GS now the cords are a little bit bent because they've been sitting in storage for quite some time and I went ahead and powered up the phone itself and you can see here that it powers on once I got the okay that it was powering on I took the plastic screen protector off there and put the phone back together now along with those 3GS Parts I got a load of 3G screen protectors so I'll also be putting a plastic screen protector on this phone to just protect the new digitizer the phone itself is in 100% mint condition the only scratching on would be on that metal band that we transferred from the old housing now compared to the old screen and housing you can see how much nicer this phone now looks it's no longer scratched and smashed so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you want to see more iPhone videos and iPhone restoration videos go ahead and check out the iPhone playlist down in the description if you're not already subscribed go

      "title": "Official iPhone 3G / 3GS Full Assembly Replacement / Screen Repair Video - iCracked.com",
      "transcript": "hey guys this is Anthony with I cracked calm today I'm going to show you how to change the full assembly on your 3G this is one of the easiest ways to remove and fix a cracked screen on your cell phone this part also will replace an LCD home button ear speaker or any sort of electronic issues you have on the front of your phone so today we have our 3g 3gs repair flow chart the tools I'll be using as well is your standard Phillips head we have our nylon spudger the SIM card removal tray and a little cleaning cloth as well as your suction cup to take off the full assembly now before we get started I'm going to show you some of the clear indicators between the 3G and 3GS so you know exactly which phone you're working with and which part to buy ok so I'm going to walk you through the differences between the 3G and 3GS from a hardware perspective so they modified a couple things this being the 3G we don't have this antenna here in this area while on the 3GS they've added this new number 7 connector also with the 3G assemblies the connections here for the digitizer LCD and the ribbon cable are slightly different they're actually slightly smaller than the 3GS which you can see and I'll show you on the connections with the full assemblies but so you can specifically see it on the LCD connector this one's much much thinner while this one has a much thicker wider connection and that just makes it easier it's a modification Apple has done a while ago that makes it easier for the connections to stay on other than internally you can look on the backside of these devices our 3GS has the model number a one three zero three here and then the 3G is a one two four one the real differences happen between these two connections here so if you're looking at the 3G you have the wires that are very very close knit to one another on both this is the LCD and then the digitizer as well and as you'll see in a second the 3GS is much much thicker as far as the plastic black that they've connected to a tomb which makes it easier and has a stronger bond between the logic board then here is the 3GS see that black bar running between the LCD makes it much easier to hold the strong connection on that logic board and they've also modified the connection here it's a smaller sort of black line plastic piece that does the same and this is a side-by-side look of the difference between the 3GS and then to the right we have the 3G so now that we know the difference is between the 3G and 3GS let's open this thing up and replace it with an brand new full assembly first thing we want to do is power off the device by holding the power button for a matter of seconds and sliding it off now step 2 is to take out these two screws here at the bottom with our standard Phillips head all right the third step is to take your suction cup and place it at the bottom side of your full assembly the screen just above the home button what we're going to do here so I'm going to take this and use my hand sort of as a lever and pull this up like so it'll open like a clam also one thing to keep in mind is when it's really cracked say like this it's hard to get a suction sort of on this so you might want to use some scotch tape and kind of like overlay the tape so you can get a better suction cup better pull on the full assembly okay so now that we have it unhinged we're going to pull pull open from the bottom half leaving the top wedge open open it like a clam because there's three connections here we have a number one connection which is the LCD number two which is the digitizer and the third is a ribbon cable which connects the speaker and proximity sensor to the logic board so we can take a nylon spudger and sort of unhinge these the number one like I said the connection is very weak on a 3G so it's already unhinged itself then we take the spudger unplug number two and then I will show you the third one that's there you see that it's held on by this little lever you have to actually take that black lever lift it up like so and then it will release the number three ribbon cable it'll slide right out okay so we've removed the full assembly from the core part of the phone now we'll take our replacement assembly this is your digitizer you have your LCD you have the whole mid frame around makes it very easy along with a brand new home button you have your speaker assembly the other proximity sensors everything is brand new and instead of doing sort of your standard digitizer replacement for this that takes about 40 minutes this takes about two minutes so now all we have to do is reverse sort of the process of this we're going to take these three connections put them on drop it down and then screw in the two bottom screws so what I'm going to do first is sort of gently Bend back this LCD connection very gently and then pull back our digitizer as well and focus on this ribbon cable so we're going to slide in the ribbon cable right away my technique is to curl it a little bit so you're able to kind of get a hinge and slide better and as you can see there's two subtle colors you have your gold sort of metal that's going to go into the into the ribbon cable port and then you have the orange sort of section so I'm going to push it all the way into that orange section okay slide it down and on now that it's in we want to lock it just by dropping down this lever then you'll kind of go backwards take the number-two connector click that in make sure you hear a click and then finally your LCD number three connection so just feel around a little bit the three G's can be a little more of a headache but just feel around be gentle okay so once you have the three connections in we're going to start to drop this full assembly down starting with the top near the speaker assembly first and then we'll slowly drop down the bottom part near the home button you want to hear a click so it's fully in placed in the and the iPhone and then we'll do before we drop these bottom screws let's just test to see if it's powering on and the LCD and everything is working correctly so LCD looks good we'll go ahead and touch the digitizer once it's fully booted while we're doing that we can go ahead and put in the new screws okay so now that we've installed it and it's rebooted we're going to go ahead test the

      "summary": "Anthony will show you how to change the full assembly on your 3G. This is one of the easiest ways to remove and fix a cracked screen on your cell phone. This part also will replace an LCD home button ear speaker or any sort of electronic issues. 3G assemblies the connections here for the digitizer LCD and the ribbon cable are slightly different they're actually slightly smaller than the 3GS. This one's much much thinner while this one has a much thicker wider connection and that just makes it easier. stronger bond between the logic board then here is the 3GS see that black bar running between the LCD makes it much easier to hold the strong connection on that logic board. They've also modified the connection here it's a smaller sort of black line plastic piece that does the same. One thing to keep in mind is when it's really cracked say like this it's hard to get a suction sort of on this so you might want to use some scotch tape and kind of like overlay the tape so you can get a better suction cup better pull on the full assembly. it'll slide right out okay so we've removed the full assembly from the core part of the phone now we'll take our replacement assembly this is your digitizer you have your LCD you have the whole mid frame around makes it very easy. gold sort of metal that's going to go into the into the ribbon cable port and then you have the orange sort of section so I'm going to push it all the way into that orange section okay slide it down and on now that it's in we want to lock it just by dropping down this lever then you'll kind of go backwards. the digitizer once it's fully booted while we're doing that we can go ahead and put in the new screws. We'll slide to unlock and test some of these numbers just to make sure everything's fully connected to the to the logic board.",
